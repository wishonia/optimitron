# Product Guidelines

## Messaging
- Lead with evidence, transparency, and reproducibility.
- Describe Optomitron as decision-support, not a replacement for legal authority.
- Emphasize domain-agnostic capability: the same engine works for health, budgets, or business metrics.
- Make uncertainty explicit (confidence intervals, evidence grades, sensitivity analysis).

## Trust and Safety
- Avoid deterministic claims about causation without evidence grades.
- Make privacy and data minimization explicit in user-facing docs.
- Provide sources for all data used in public reports.

## Scope Discipline
- Keep the core engine agnostic to domain-specific politics or ideology.
- Keep normative choices (objective functions, weights) explicit and configurable.
- Separate data ingestion, causal inference, and recommendation layers cleanly.

## Pilot Framing
- Position the US federal pilot as a reproducible public-good analysis.
- Make it easy for any jurisdiction to rerun with their own data.
- Be explicit about what is simulated vs. sourced from real datasets.

## Analysis Methodology (Updated 2026-02-07)

### Metrics Hierarchy
1. **Change from baseline** (primary) — "Above-average spending → X% better outcome"
2. **z-score** (for ranking) — normalizes across different outcome scales
3. **Cohen's d** (effect size) — small/medium/large standardized magnitude
4. **Pearson r** (supplementary) — traditional correlation, NOT the headline
5. **Predictive Pearson** (causal direction) — forward r minus reverse r
6. **Causal Direction Score** — composite of evidence for A→B vs B→A

### Reporting Rules
- Lead with intuitive, human-readable findings (change from baseline)
- Always include sample size and confidence level
- Apply Bonferroni correction when running multiple tests
- Flag reverse causation explicitly (spending responding to crises)
- Include COVID sensitivity check for any analysis touching 2020-2021
- Be honest about limitations — better to be credibly modest than impressively wrong

### Data Rules
- **Deflator**: GDP deflator for US govt spending, World Bank PPP for cross-country
- **NOT CPI** for government spending (CPI reflects consumer basket, not govt mix)
- **NOT % of GDP** as primary metric (GDP growth ≠ need for proportional spending)
- **Real per-capita PPP** is the standard for cross-country comparisons
- **YoY % change** for causal detection (strips monotonic trends)
- **Absolute real per-capita** for determining optimal spending LEVELS
- Always cite data sources in JSDoc and report footnotes
