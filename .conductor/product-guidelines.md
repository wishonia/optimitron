# Product Guidelines

## Messaging
- Lead with evidence, transparency, and reproducibility.
- Describe Optomitron as decision-support, not a replacement for legal authority.
- Emphasize domain-agnostic capability: the same engine works for health, budgets, or business metrics.
- Make uncertainty explicit (confidence intervals, evidence grades, sensitivity analysis).

## Trust and Safety
- Avoid deterministic claims about causation without evidence grades.
- Make privacy and data minimization explicit in user-facing docs.
- Provide sources for all data used in public reports.

## Scope Discipline
- Keep the core engine agnostic to domain-specific politics or ideology.
- Keep normative choices (objective functions, weights) explicit and configurable.
- Separate data ingestion, causal inference, and recommendation layers cleanly.

## Pilot Framing
- Position the US federal pilot as a reproducible public-good analysis.
- Make it easy for any jurisdiction to rerun with their own data.
- Be explicit about what is simulated vs. sourced from real datasets.

## Analysis Methodology (Updated 2026-02-07)

### Metrics Hierarchy
1. **Change from baseline** (primary) — "Above-average spending → X% better outcome"
2. **z-score** (for ranking) — normalizes across different outcome scales
3. **Cohen's d** (effect size) — small/medium/large standardized magnitude
4. **Pearson r** (supplementary) — traditional correlation, NOT the headline
5. **Predictive Pearson** (causal direction) — forward r minus reverse r
6. **Causal Direction Score** — composite of evidence for A→B vs B→A

### Reporting Rules
- Lead with intuitive, human-readable findings (change from baseline)
- Always include sample size and confidence level
- Apply Bonferroni correction when running multiple tests
- Flag reverse causation explicitly (spending responding to crises)
- Include COVID sensitivity check for any analysis touching 2020-2021
- Be honest about limitations — better to be credibly modest than impressively wrong

### Direct Outcome Mapping
Always use the MOST DIRECT outcome for each spending category, not just generic LE/income:

| Category | Direct Outcomes | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Drug enforcement | Overdose deaths, drug use rates, drug seizures | Direct causal pathway |
| Education | PISA scores, graduation rates, literacy | Proximal to intervention |
| Healthcare | Preventable deaths, infant mortality, HALE | Measures healthcare quality |
| Criminal justice | Crime rates, recidivism, incarceration rate | Direct policy target |
| Military | Conflict deaths, defense capability index | Security outcomes |
| R&D | Patents filed, productivity growth, tech exports | Innovation output |
| Environmental | CO2 emissions, air quality index, cancer rates | Environmental health |
| Social protection | Poverty rate, food insecurity, homelessness | Direct welfare measures |
| Infrastructure | Commute times, broadband access, bridge condition | Infrastructure quality |
| Foreign aid | Recipient country LE/poverty, refugee flows | Aid effectiveness |

Generic outcomes (LE, GDP/capita) are SUPPLEMENTARY — they show the full chain but dilute the signal.
Run analyses with BOTH direct and generic outcomes, lead with direct in reports.

### Optimization Framing: Minimum Effective Spending
The analysis shows that more government spending doesn't detectably improve outcomes in rich OECD countries.
Therefore the optimization question is NOT "how much should you spend to maximize outcomes" but rather
"what's the MINIMUM you can spend without outcomes getting worse?"

This is the "minimum effective dose" approach:
1. Find the spending FLOOR per category — below which outcomes detectably worsen
2. Everything above that floor is waste or captured by intermediaries
3. The optimal budget = floor level for each category
4. Efficient frontier countries (high outcomes, low spending) are the benchmark
5. "Overspend ratio" = current spending / floor level — the key metric

Example: Japan spends $4,200/cap on health, lives 4 years longer than US at $10,000/cap.
The floor is ~$3,500-4,000/cap. The US overspends by 2.5x for zero additional benefit.

### Confound Control (CRITICAL)
Cross-country correlations are confounded by wealth. Rich countries spend more on EVERYTHING and have better outcomes. Every cross-country analysis MUST:

1. **Compute partial correlations controlling for GDP per capita** — `partial_r(spending, outcome | GDP)`
2. **Flag categories where the effect vanishes after controlling** — "confounded, insufficient evidence"
3. **Report BOTH simple and partial correlations** — the gap reveals how much was just "being rich"
4. **Sign flips are disqualifying** — if education→LE is positive simple but zero/negative partial, the recommendation is bogus
5. **Within-country YoY analysis is the tiebreaker** — if cross-country says positive but within-country YoY says null/negative, trust the YoY

The optimizer library should do this automatically: `runFullAnalysis()` with cross-country data should compute partial correlations as a standard step.

### Data Rules
- **Deflator**: GDP deflator for US govt spending, World Bank PPP for cross-country
- **NOT CPI** for government spending (CPI reflects consumer basket, not govt mix)
- **NOT % of GDP** as primary metric (GDP growth ≠ need for proportional spending)
- **Real per-capita PPP** is the standard for cross-country comparisons
- **YoY % change** for causal detection (strips monotonic trends)
- **Absolute real per-capita** for determining optimal spending LEVELS
- Always cite data sources in JSDoc and report footnotes
