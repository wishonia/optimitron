# Plan: OECD + Direct Outcomes + FRED Improvements (v2)

1. [x] Replace synthetic OECD direct outcomes with sourced series or mark explicitly as simulated.
   - ✅ Already done: `oecd-direct-outcomes.ts` has explicit SIMULATED markers on all fields + DATA_PROVENANCE tracking
2. [x] Add WHO HALE fetcher and wire dataset usage.
3. Expand OECD panel to include direct outcomes fields (education, healthcare, crime, climate).
   - Currently missing: Education outcomes (PISA?), Crime (Homicide is there, maybe Safety?), Climate (CO2 emissions?), Healthcare outcomes (beyond LE/HALE/Infant Mortality - maybe Cancer survival?)
   - Add explicit education-outcome ingestion tasks:
     - international student-performance panel fields suitable for longitudinal pair analysis
     - coverage diagnostics by jurisdiction/year for education outcomes
     - transform-ready annual alignment metadata so optimizer lag windows are not inferred from sparse raw periodicity
4. Add GDP deflator option for US spending conversion.
5. Add caching and versioning metadata for static datasets.
6. Improve FRED fetcher reliability (keys, rate-limit handling).
7. [x] Publish dual-scale spending diagnostics in government-size outputs: `% GDP` bins + derived per-capita PPP bins.
   - Added adaptive binning metadata to JSON and companion markdown table (2026-02-13).
8. [x] Ensure reproducible workspace execution for examples by building upstream package deps before generation/tests.
   - `packages/examples/package.json` now runs `build:deps` ahead of `generate:*`, demos, and tests (2026-02-13).
9. [x] Define and publish `VariableRegistry` seed dataset for all predictor/outcome IDs.
   - Implemented in `packages/data/src/variable-registry.ts` with exported schema + helper APIs.
   - Includes units, directionality, coverage windows/status, transforms, and lag defaults.
10. [x] Add precompute index metadata for heavy pair analyses.
   - Implemented explorer precompute index in `packages/web/src/lib/analysis-explorer-data.ts`.
   - Added source fingerprints + cache key hash + counts:
     - outcomes, predictors, pairs, subjects
   - Added cache invalidation check using source hash snapshots.
   - Surfaced metadata in `ProvenanceBlock` on outcomes/outcome-hub/pair-study pages.
11. [x] Fix WHO HALE coverage interoperability in registry-wide pair generation.
   - Fixed WHO OData period filtering in `packages/data/src/fetchers/who.ts`:
     - `TimeDim` filters now use numeric years (unquoted) to avoid type-mismatch `400 Bad Request`.
   - Added robust sex-dimension fallback:
     - initial query attempts `Dim1 eq 'BTSX'`
     - automatically retries without `Dim1` when indicator rows are empty or request fails.
- Added transient retry/backoff for WHO request instability (`UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, retryable HTTP statuses).
- Added regression coverage in `packages/data/src/__tests__/fetchers/who.test.ts` for:
     - no-`Dim1` fallback behavior
     - transient network retry behavior
- Validation:
  - `pnpm --filter @optomitron/examples generate:mega-studies` now produces 64/64 pair studies with HALE included (zero skipped pairs).
- Added a dedicated government-spending metric comparison artifact for source transparency:
  - documents competing definitions, US context estimates, and cross-country default recommendation.
12. [x] Publish government spending metric taxonomy + source-comparison artifact.
   - Added generator: `packages/examples/src/us-federal-analysis/generate-government-spending-metric-comparison.ts`.
   - Added npm script: `pnpm --filter @optomitron/examples generate:government-spending-metrics`.
   - Publishes:
     - `packages/examples/output/government-spending-metric-comparison.md`
     - `packages/examples/output/government-spending-metric-comparison.json`
   - Includes:
     - internationally comparable metric definitions and coverage snapshots
     - US-only context estimates (not panel defaults)
     - explicit primary-metric recommendation for cross-country analysis.
13. [x] Download reproducible aggregated N-of-1 drug-war proxy panel inputs.
   - Added raw source bundle under `packages/data/raw/aggregated-nof1/`:
     - OECD COFOG public-order spending (`GF03`, `S13`, `OTE`, annual)
     - OECD accidental-poisoning mortality (`CICDPOSN`, deaths per 100k)
     - World Bank GDP current LCU, GDP per capita PPP (current), population, and poisoning mortality
   - Added derived merged panel:
     - `derived-drug-war-proxy-panel.csv`
     - computed `% GDP` and `per-capita PPP` spending proxy columns for direct modeling.
   - Added local provenance metadata:
     - `download-manifest.json`
     - `derived-drug-war-proxy-panel.coverage.json`
14. [x] Expose aggregated proxy panel as a typed dataset loader in `@optomitron/data`.
   - Added `datasets/aggregated-nof1-drug-war-proxy.ts` with:
     - typed row interface
     - CSV parser
     - default file loader
   - Exported through `datasets/index.ts` and covered with parser/loader tests.
15. [x] Add estimated drug-enforcement panel (cross-jurisdiction) and typed loader.
   - Added UNODC input:
     - `unodc-cts-access-justice-2025.xlsx` (UN-CTS arrests by selected crime + total arrests)
   - Added enriched derived panel:
     - `derived-drug-enforcement-panel.csv`
     - `derived-drug-enforcement-panel.coverage.json`
   - Predictor derivations:
     - `estimatedDrugTraffickingEnforcementSpendingPerCapitaPpp`
     - `estimatedDrugLawEnforcementSpendingPerCapitaPpp`
     - both derived from GF03 PPP-per-capita spending weighted by UNODC arrest shares.
   - Added typed dataset loader:
     - `datasets/aggregated-nof1-drug-enforcement.ts`
     - exported in `datasets/index.ts`
     - parser/loader tests added.
