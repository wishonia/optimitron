# Plan: OECD + Direct Outcomes + FRED Improvements (v2)

1. [x] Replace synthetic OECD direct outcomes with sourced series or mark explicitly as simulated.
   - ✅ Already done: `oecd-direct-outcomes.ts` has explicit SIMULATED markers on all fields + DATA_PROVENANCE tracking
2. [x] Add WHO HALE fetcher and wire dataset usage.
3. Expand OECD panel to include direct outcomes fields (education, healthcare, crime, climate).
   - Currently missing: Education outcomes (PISA?), Crime (Homicide is there, maybe Safety?), Climate (CO2 emissions?), Healthcare outcomes (beyond LE/HALE/Infant Mortality - maybe Cancer survival?)
4. Add GDP deflator option for US spending conversion.
5. Add caching and versioning metadata for static datasets.
6. Improve FRED fetcher reliability (keys, rate-limit handling).
