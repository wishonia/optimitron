# Optomitron

**Optomitron optimizes everyone's health, wealth, and happiness — as well as that of humanity — using time series data and causal inference.**

We're building the operating system for evidence-based decision-making. Whether you're a person trying to figure out if magnesium helps you sleep, a city deciding where to spend its budget, or a business optimizing ad spend — the math is the same. Optomitron provides a universal causal inference engine that takes any two time series and answers: *Does changing X cause Y to change? By how much? What's the optimal value of X?*

## The Problem

**Governments fly blind.** The US federal government allocates a [$6.75 trillion budget](https://www.cbo.gov/topics/budget) based on political negotiation, not evidence. Nobody knows the optimal amount to spend on education vs. healthcare vs. defense — or even how to measure it. The same is true for every city, county, and state.

**Individuals fly blind too.** 77% of Americans take dietary supplements, but almost none of them know whether those supplements actually work *for them*. People make health decisions based on anecdote, marketing, and vibes — not data.

**Businesses guess.** Marketing budgets, pricing strategies, and feature investments are set by intuition and A/B tests that measure correlation, not causation.

**The core issue is the same everywhere:** we have time series data and we need to know what causes what. The tools to answer that question should be universal, open, and free.

## The Solution

Optomitron is a five-layer system that turns raw data into optimal decisions:

| Layer | Name | What It Does |
|:-----:|------|-------------|
| 🔒 | **Digital Twin Safe** | All personal data stays on your device. Causal engine runs locally. |
| 🪪 | **Decentralized Identity** | Proof-of-personhood (ZK) — one person, one vote, zero surveillance. |
| ⛓️ | **Anonymous On-Chain** | Anonymized effect sizes stored publicly. No single entity owns the data. |
| 📊 | **Aggregation Server** | Meta-analysis across all submissions → population-level insights. |
| 💸 | **Incentive Layer** | Data contribution tokens + automatic campaign funding for aligned politicians. |

```

1. **Collect** — Import time series data from any source: wearables, health apps, government statistics, business metrics.
2. **Align** — Pair predictor and outcome measurements using configurable onset delays and durations of action.
3. **Score** — Apply all 9 Bradford Hill criteria for causation via saturation functions, producing a Predictor Impact Score (PIS) with evidence grade (A–F).
4. **Optimize** — Find the optimal predictor value (dosage, spending level, price point) that produces the best outcomes, with confidence intervals.
5. **Recommend** — Generate actionable recommendations: take this supplement, enact this policy, allocate this budget, fund this candidate.

## For Individuals

### 🔒 Digital Twin Safe

Your health data never leaves your device. Optomitron's causal engine is **pure TypeScript with zero server dependency** — it runs entirely in your browser or Electron app.

- **Import** from Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, Garmin, Oura Ring, or manual entry
- **Discover** which treatments, supplements, foods, and habits actually improve *your* outcomes
- **Get optimal values** — not just "magnesium helps sleep" but "450mg of magnesium is *your* personal optimum"
- **Evidence grades** (A–F) so you know how confident the engine is
- **Optionally share** anonymized effect sizes to help build population-level knowledge

```typescript
import { calculatePredictorImpactScore } from '@optomitron/optimizer';

const result = calculatePredictorImpactScore(
  magnesiumIntake,   // predictor time series
  sleepQuality       // outcome time series
);

console.log(result.effectSize);     // +18% improvement
console.log(result.optimalValue);   // 450 mg/day
console.log(result.evidenceGrade);  // "B"
```

## For Governments

### 🏛️ Government OS

Deploy Optomitron for any jurisdiction — city, county, state, or country — as a data-driven governance operating system.

- **Preference collection** — Citizens do pairwise comparisons ("Given $100, split between education and healthcare") via RAPPA surveys
- **Budget optimization** — Diminishing returns modeling finds the Optimal Spending Level for each category
- **Policy scoring** — Cross-jurisdiction quasi-experiments + Bradford Hill criteria → Causal Confidence Scores for every policy
- **Accountability** — Citizen Alignment Scores measure how well each politician's votes match constituent preferences
- **Cross-jurisdiction comparison** — "City A spends $X on transit and gets Y commute times vs. City B"

The database is multi-tenant: every jurisdiction is a tenant with its own priorities, officials, and data. Think Shopify, but for governments.

## For Businesses

### 📈 Same Engine, Different Domain

`@optomitron/optimizer` is **completely domain-agnostic**. It doesn't know the difference between a drug and an ad campaign. Feed it any two time series and it answers: *Does X cause Y? By how much? What's the optimal value of X?*

| Domain | Predictor (X) | Outcome (Y) | Question |
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Marketing | Ad spend | Revenue | "What's the optimal weekly ad budget?" |
| Pricing | Price point | Conversion rate | "What price maximizes revenue?" |
| Product | Feature release | User retention | "Did this feature improve retention?" |
| Manufacturing | Temperature | Defect rate | "What setting minimizes defects?" |
| Agriculture | Fertilizer | Crop yield | "What's the optimal fertilizer level?" |

All use the same pipeline: **Temporal alignment → Bradford Hill → Predictor Impact Score → Optimal value.**

```

**Hard rules:**
- `causal` depends on **nothing** — it's the foundation
- Library packages are **pure TypeScript** — no server, no database
- `causal` is **domain-agnostic** — no references to "drugs", "policies", or "budgets"
- No circular dependencies

## Contributing

```bash
# Install
pnpm install

# Full check (typecheck + lint + test) — must pass before committing
pnpm check

# Run tests for a specific package
pnpm --filter @optomitron/optimizer test

# Build all packages
pnpm build
```

### Guidelines

- **Every function gets a test.** No exceptions.
- **TypeScript strict mode** is on — `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`, no `any`.
- **Conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`
- **Lint-staged + Husky** pre-commit hooks run automatically.
- **Zod schemas** for runtime validation where types alone aren't enough.
- Functions should be <30 lines, files <300 lines.
- Read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the full developer guide and methodology references.
