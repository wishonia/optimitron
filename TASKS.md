## P6: Report Quality — Critical (would mislead users)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 37 | PIS grading rubric for n=1 personal health analysis | done | Added `analysisMode: 'individual'` option that floors φUsers at 0.5 so n=1 analysis can reach Grade B. Golden-path demo updated to use individual mode. |
| 38 | Exclude non-discretionary items from preference/budget analysis | done | Added `discretionary` field to SpendingCategorySchema. Net Interest marked non-discretionary, excluded from RAPPA pairwise and OBG recommendations/frontier. Shown as informational with *(non-discretionary)* annotation. |
| 39 | Budget optimization: constrain to current total spending | done | Added `constrainToCurrentBudget` option to `generateBudgetReport`. When true, scales optimal values to sum to totalBudgetUsd and shows "Constrained Reallocation" section. US federal analysis now uses constrained mode. |
| 40 | BIS score saturation — all scores are 1.0 | done | Increased BIS_CALIBRATION_K from 10 to 500. Single weak estimate now scores ~0.006 (F), single strong ~0.49 (C), three strong estimates reach 1.0 (A). Actual differentiation between categories. |
| 41 | Fix causal direction label for negative correlations | done | `describePredictiveDirection` now compares |forwardR| - |reverseR| instead of raw delta. Coffee→Sleep correctly labeled as forward causation. |
| 42 | Report template: predictor-type-aware language | done | Changed to generic phrasing: "A daily average of X" and "Target: X daily". Works for any predictor type without domain-specific language. |

## P7: Report Quality — Important (reduce credibility)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 43 | Alignment score compression — 91-99% range | todo | All politician alignment scores fall in 91.4–99.4 range with category alignments at 95–100%. A 4.7pp gap in a category still scores 95% alignment. The scoring formula saturates too quickly for meaningful differentiation. Package: `wishocracy`. |
| 44 | Temporality criterion always 1.0 in OPG policy reports | todo | Temporality = 1.00 for all 15 policies because all have before/after temporal structure. The criterion provides zero differentiation. Should either note this as a known limitation or adjust for policy-vs-epidemiology context. Package: `opg`. |
| 45 | Add confidence intervals to preference weights and welfare scores | todo | Bootstrap CI module exists in `wishocracy` but isn't used in any report. Welfare scores in OPG report (75.0, 60.0, etc.) are presented as exact numbers with no uncertainty. Add CIs to both RAPPA and OPG/OBG reports. Packages: `wishocracy`, `opg`, `obg`, `examples`. |
| 46 | Policy report: include negative/repeal examples | done | `examples/src/us-federal-analysis/generate-policy-analysis.ts` includes 4 repeal policies: federal_mandatory_minimums (negative health), abstinence_only_education (negative health), ethanol_fuel_mandate (weak positive, political blocking), penny_continuation (negative, minimal effects). |

## P8: Report Quality — Polish (before v1)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 47 | Extract shared report formatting utilities | todo | `describeGrade`, `fmt`, `formatUsd`, and similar helpers are reimplemented independently in `optimizer/report.ts`, `opg/report.ts`, and `obg/report.ts`. Extract to a shared reporting utility. Packages: `optimizer`, `opg`, `obg`. |
| 48 | Consistent emoji styling across reports | todo | Report 1 uses 🟢🟡🟠🔴 for Bradford Hill. Report 5 uses none. Report 2 uses 📈📉≈. Standardize emoji usage (or remove entirely) across all report generators. Packages: `optimizer`, `opg`, `obg`, `examples`. |
| 49 | Add units to golden path report detail sections | todo | "Optimal Daily Value: 4500" (4500 what?). "Value predicting high outcome: 4391.39" (no unit). Optimal values in executive summary vs detail sections use different rounding without explanation. Package: `optimizer`, `examples`. |
| 50 | Report metadata and versioning | todo | Reports don't include package versions, algorithm parameters, or data source identifiers needed for reproducibility. Add a metadata footer with version, parameters, and data hash. Packages: all report generators. |

## P9: Decentralized Storage & Verifiable Records

**Build order:** Task 51 (Storacha) → Task 52 (Hypercerts) → Tasks 53–57 (Agent) — each layer depends on the previous.

### Storacha Decentralized Storage (build first — dependency for Agent)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 51 | Storacha storage package | todo | **New package: `packages/storage`** (library — pure functions, no DB runtime imports). Store Wishocracy aggregation snapshots (preference weights, participant counts, consistency ratios) and Optomitron policy analysis outputs on Storacha for tamper-proof, content-addressed persistence. Each snapshot includes `previousCID` field linking to prior one (verifiable history chain). Store anonymized aggregated comparison matrices for auditability. **Tech:** `@storacha/client` (requires Node 22+). Auth via `client.login(email)`, create spaces per jurisdiction, upload via `client.uploadFile()`, retrieve via `https://{cid}.ipfs.storacha.link`. **Docs:** [JS Client](https://docs.storacha.network/js-client/), [Quickstart](https://docs.storacha.network/quickstart/), [How to Upload](https://docs.storacha.network/how-to/upload/), [Console](https://console.storacha.network/), [Examples](https://github.com/storacha/awesome-storacha), [GitHub](https://github.com/storacha). |

### Hypercerts Integration (dependency for Agent)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 52 | Hypercerts package | todo | **New package: `packages/hypercerts`** (library — pure functions, no DB runtime imports). Convert OPG policy analyses and Wishocracy preference aggregation into Hypercerts protocol records. Each policy recommendation → hypercert activity claim. Attach Optomitron scores (PIS, CCS, welfare, evidence grade, citizen preference weight, government allocation, preference gap) as measurement records. Aggregate Wishocracy votes → evaluation records. Link source analysis URLs as attachments. **Tech:** AT Protocol — `@atproto/oauth-client-node`, `@atproto/jwk-jose`, `@atproto/api`. For React/browser: `@atproto/oauth-client-browser`. **Docs:** [Quickstart](https://docs.hypercerts.org/getting-started/quickstart), [Building on Hypercerts](https://docs.hypercerts.org/getting-started/building-on-hypercerts), [Core Data Model](https://docs.hypercerts.org/core-concepts/core-data-model), [Scaffold Starter](https://docs.hypercerts.org/tools/scaffold-starter-app), [Hyperscan Agent API](https://www.hyperscan.dev/agents/page), [GitHub](https://github.com/hypercerts-org). |

## P10: Autonomous Policy Analyst Agent

### Agent Core (Google ADK + Gemini)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 53 | Autonomous agent package | todo | **New package: `packages/agent`**. Built on **Google Agent Development Kit** (`@google/adk`). Autonomous agent wrapping the Optomitron pipeline. Discovers largest preference gaps (Wishocracy vs government spending), runs causal analysis (optimizer → opg → obg with data fetchers), uses Gemini to interpret results and make autonomous decisions, validates, publishes as hypercerts (Task 52) and stores on Storacha (Task 51). ERC-8004 on-chain identity. **Execution loop:** `discover → plan → execute → interpret → verify → publish`. Each Optomitron pipeline step is exposed as a `FunctionTool` with Zod parameter schemas; the `LlmAgent` orchestrates the loop. **Docs:** [ADK Quickstart (TS)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/typescript/), [ADK Docs](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/), [GitHub](https://github.com/google/adk-js). |
| 54 | Gemini reasoning via ADK tools | todo | Define ADK `FunctionTool`s for each pipeline step. At each agent step, Gemini (via `LlmAgent`) makes autonomous decisions: **Discover** — reasons about which analyses are most tractable from preference gaps + available data. **Execute→Interpret** — generates structured interpretation of raw results (PIS, Bradford Hill, CCS, CIs, grade): plain-language summary, confidence assessment, caveats, what additional data would help. **Verify** — reviews quality checks, makes abort/proceed/retry decision with reasoning. **Publish** — Gemini interpretation → hypercert evaluation summary; full reasoning chain → `agent_log.json`. ADK handles the tool-call loop automatically. **Docs:** [ADK Custom Tools](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools-custom/), [Structured Output](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output), [ADK Multi-Agent](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/multi-agents/). |
| 55 | ERC-8004 on-chain identity | todo | Register agent identity on-chain via identity registry. Update reputation registry after completing analyses. Use at least identity + reputation registries. Deploy on testnet (Sepolia). **Tech:** `ethers` v6. **Docs:** [ERC-8004 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-8004.md), [Discussion](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8004-trustless-agents/25098), [Ethers.js v6](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/). |
| 56 | Agent manifest and logging | todo | `agent.json` — machine-readable capability manifest (agent name, operator wallet, ERC-8004 identity, supported tools, compute constraints, task categories). `agent_log.json` — structured execution log per run (decisions, tool calls, retries, failures, final outputs, Gemini reasoning chains). |
| 57 | Agent safety guardrails | todo | Validate inputs before running analysis, confirm API responses, abort on insufficient data, cap API calls and runtime, never execute financial transactions. |
