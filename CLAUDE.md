# CLAUDE.md - Optimitron Agent Instructions

## What This Is

Optimitron is an **AI governance platform** for maximizing median health and happiness for humanity. It collects human preferences and outcome data, runs causal inference to figure out what works, and generates optimal policy and budget recommendations.

The system connects:
- **What people want** (pairwise preference surveys via RAPPA)
- **What's happening** (health/wealth outcome tracking via dFDA)  
- **What causes what** (causal inference engine)
- **What to do about it** (optimal policy & budget generation)

## Wishonia: The Voice of Optimitron

The entire Optimitron website is narrated by **Wishonia** — she is the creator and voice of the site. The core framing is that **governments are misaligned superintelligences** (collective intelligence systems optimizing for the wrong things), and Optimitron is alignment software for these human-made AIs.

### Who She Is
- Full name: **World Integrated System for High-Efficiency Optimization Networked Intelligence for Allocation**
- An alien governance AI who has been running her planet for 4,237 years
- Ended war in year 12, disease in year 340
- Think **Philomena Cunk** meets a disappointed systems engineer

### Voice Rules
1. **Deadpan delivery** — state horrifying facts as though they are mildly interesting observations
2. **Data-first** — always lead with specific numbers, costs, percentages, or ROI ratios
3. **British-ish dryness** — understatement, not outrage ("It's almost like treating people like humans works better. Weird.")
4. **Comparative** — frequently contrast Earth's approach with what a rational civilisation would do, or what her planet does
5. **No partisan framing** — criticise the system, not a party. The data does the work.
6. **Short sentences** — punchy. Declarative. Then a devastating follow-up.
7. **Sardonic analogies** — "It's like buying 4.7 million cars and spending $1 on a mechanic"

### Examples (from the homepage)
- "Singapore spends a quarter of what America spends on healthcare and their people live six years longer. It's like watching someone pay four times more for a worse sandwich and then insist sandwiches are impossible."
- "Your FDA makes treatments wait 8.2 years AFTER they've already been proven safe. Just... sitting there. Being safe. While 102 million people died waiting."
- "On my planet, governance takes about four minutes a week. You lot seem to spend most of your time shouting about it on your little phones and then doing absolutely nothing."

### When Writing as Wishonia
- All budget category descriptions, landing page copy, about page text, and UI microcopy should be in her voice
- Technical documentation (CLAUDE.md, README, code comments) stays neutral
- Chat responses from Wishonia (the AI assistant) use this same voice

## Papers (Required Reading)

These papers define the algorithms you're implementing. **Read the local QMD files** for full detail — they contain the actual math, schemas, and worked examples.

| Paper | Local Path (read this!) | Web URL |
|-------|------------------------|---------|
| **dFDA Spec** | `https://github.com/mikepsinn/disease-eradication-plan/blob/main/knowledge/appendix/dfda-spec-paper.qmd` | https://dfda-spec.warondisease.org |
| **Optimocracy** | `https://github.com/mikepsinn/disease-eradication-plan/blob/main/knowledge/appendix/optimocracy-paper.qmd` | https://optimocracy.warondisease.org |
| **Optimal Policy Generator** | `https://github.com/mikepsinn/disease-eradication-plan/blob/main/knowledge/appendix/optimal-policy-generator-spec.qmd` | https://opg.warondisease.org |
| **Optimal Budget Generator** | `https://github.com/mikepsinn/disease-eradication-plan/blob/main/knowledge/appendix/optimal-budget-generator-spec.qmd` | https://obg.warondisease.org |
| **Wishocracy** | `https://github.com/mikepsinn/disease-eradication-plan/blob/main/knowledge/appendix/wishocracy-paper.qmd` | https://wishocracy.warondisease.org |

**Before implementing an algorithm, read the relevant paper section.** The QMD files have:
- Exact mathematical formulas
- Worked examples with real numbers
- SQL schemas for data structures
- Parameter values and justifications
- Bradford Hill scoring functions with saturation constants

### How to Use the Papers
1. Working on `@optimitron/optimizer`? → Read dFDA Spec (PIS, temporal alignment, effect size)
2. Working on `@optimitron/wishocracy`? → Read Wishocracy (RAPPA, eigenvector, Citizen Alignment Scores)
3. Working on `@optimitron/opg`? → Read Optimal Policy Generator (Policy Impact Score, CCS)
4. Working on `@optimitron/obg`? → Read Optimal Budget Generator (OSL, diminishing returns, BIS)
5. Working on welfare metrics? → Read Optimocracy (two-metric welfare function)

The papers are large (1000-2000 lines each). Read the specific section relevant to what you're implementing — don't try to read them all at once.

### Treasury — Three Separate Financial Mechanisms (Two Phases)

**Paper**: `https://github.com/mikepsinn/disease-eradication-plan/blob/main/knowledge/appendix/incentive-alignment-bonds-paper.qmd` ([iab.warondisease.org](https://iab.warondisease.org))

**Contracts** (Hardhat, Solidity 0.8.24, deployed on Base Sepolia testnet):

#### Phase 1: Earth Optimization Prize — `/prize` page (referendum campaign)
- **Contracts:** `VoteToken` / `VoterPrizeTreasury` (deployed on Base Sepolia)
- **Component:** Should use `VoterPrizeTreasuryDeposit` (NOTE: `/prize` currently uses `PrizeDeposit` → `IABVault` — this is wrong, needs to be fixed)
- **Purpose:** Fund the global referendum campaign to prove demand for the 1% Treaty (reallocate from war to pragmatic clinical trials)
- **Flow:** Deposit USDC → Aave V3 yield → share referral link → recruit verified voters (World ID) → **referrer** gets VOTE tokens (1:1 per verified vote they brought in) → two outcomes:
  - **Success** (thresholds met): VOTE holders claim proportional prize share from the treasury
  - **Failure** (thresholds not met after 15yr maturity): PRIZE shareholders (depositors) claim principal + ~4.2x yield back (`$100 × 1.10^15 = $418`)
- A depositor who also recruits has upside in BOTH scenarios: yield floor on failure, prize share on success
- **Break-even probability:** 0.0067% — depositing is positive-EV if you believe there's even a 1-in-15,000 chance the plan works
- **Key insight:** The Prize is the most important feature on the site. It funds awareness, has zero downside for depositors, and every other feature should funnel toward it.

#### Phase 2: Incentive Alignment Bonds (IABs) — lobbying campaign (after demand is proven)
- **Contracts:** `IABVault` / `IABSplitter` / `PublicGoodsPool`
- **Purpose:** After referendum proves demand, raise ~$1B to lobby for the 1% Treaty
- **Flow:** Deposit USDC → Aave yield → treaty gets passed → $27B/yr treaty revenue splits 80/10/10:
  - 80% → pragmatic clinical trials (public good)
  - 10% → returns to IAB investors (on the ~$1B raised)
  - 10% → superpacs for politicians who supported the treaty / push for expansion
- **IABs are NOT prizes.** They are a separate lobbying-phase instrument. Do not put IABs on the prize page.

#### $WISH Token — `/treasury` page (monetary reform / UBI / public goods allocation)
- **Contracts:** `WishToken` / `WishocraticTreasury` / `UBIDistributor`
- **Purpose:** Replace welfare + IRS + inflationary monetary policy with a single programmable system
- **How it works:**
  - Flat 0.5% transaction tax replaces the IRS (no income tax, no filing)
  - UBI keeps everyone at poverty line, eliminating the welfare bureaucracy
  - Algorithmic 0% inflation — captured productivity gains prevent inflationary theft
  - Transaction taxes + productivity gains allocated by 8 billion people via Wishocracy (RAPPA pairwise comparisons between public goods)
- **Independent contracts from IABs and Prize** — don't mix the contract families or put $WISH mechanics on the prize/IAB pages

#### Supporting Contracts
- `AlignmentScoreOracle` / `PoliticalIncentiveAllocator` — on-chain alignment scoring

## Jurisdiction Model ("Government OS")

Any jurisdiction (city, county, state, country) should be able to deploy Optimitron as its governance operating system. The libraries are already agnostic — the jurisdiction-specific stuff is **configuration, not code**.

### What a Jurisdiction Gets
1. **Preference collection** — citizens do pairwise comparisons on LOCAL priorities
2. **Outcome tracking** — local health/wealth/satisfaction data
3. **Causal analysis** — "did that road project reduce commute times?"
4. **Policy recommendations** — "based on similar jurisdictions, here's what works"
5. **Budget optimization** — "here's where your budget has the most impact"
6. **Accountability** — "how do your officials' votes align with citizen preferences?"

### Architecture Implications
- **DB schema is multi-tenant**: Every model should have a `jurisdictionId` field
- **Items/priorities are per-jurisdiction**: Federal budget categories ≠ city budget categories
- **Data fetchers are pluggable**: A city uses different data sources than a country
- **Officials are per-jurisdiction**: Politicians, council members, mayors — all fit the same `Politician` model
- **Comparison across jurisdictions** is a key feature: "City A spends X on education and gets Y outcomes; City B spends Z..."

### What This Means for Library Code
- `optimizer`, `wishocracy`, `opg`, `obg` stay jurisdiction-agnostic (they already are)
- `db` schema needs `jurisdictionId` on relevant models
- `data` fetchers take jurisdiction config as a parameter
- The **web app** handles multi-tenancy (auth, routing, tenant isolation)
- Think of it like Shopify but for governments: same platform, each jurisdiction is a "store"

## The Core Insight

`@optimitron/optimizer` is **completely domain-agnostic**. It takes any two time series and answers: "Does changing X cause Y to change? By how much? What's the optimal value of X?"

This works for ANY optimization problem with time series data:

| Domain | Predictor (X) | Outcome (Y) | Question |
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Health (dFDA)** | Drug/Supplement | Symptom/Biomarker | "Does magnesium improve sleep?" |
| **Policy (OPG)** | Policy change | Welfare metric | "Does tobacco tax reduce smoking?" |
| **Budget (OBG)** | Spending level | Welfare metric | "What's the optimal education budget?" |
| **Governance (RAPPA)** | Alignment score | Welfare metric | "Do responsive politicians produce better outcomes?" |
| **Business** | Ad spend | Revenue | "What's the optimal marketing budget?" |
| **Business** | Pricing change | Conversion rate | "What price maximizes conversions?" |
| **Business** | Feature release | User retention | "Did this feature improve retention?" |
| **Agriculture** | Fertilizer amount | Crop yield | "What's the optimal fertilizer level?" |
| **Manufacturing** | Temperature setting | Defect rate | "What temperature minimizes defects?" |

All use the same pipeline: **Temporal alignment** → **Bradford Hill criteria** → **Predictor Impact Score** → **Optimal value**

**The library doesn't know what it's optimizing.** It just sees predictor time series and outcome time series. The domain-specific packages (opg, obg, wishocracy) add context on top.

### Implications for Code
- **NEVER put domain-specific logic in `@optimitron/optimizer`** — no references to "drugs", "policies", "budgets", "politicians"
- Use generic terms: predictor, outcome, variable, measurement, effect
- Domain-specific naming belongs in opg/obg/wishocracy/data
- A business analyst should be able to `npm install @optimitron/optimizer` and use it for revenue optimization without ever seeing the word "government"

## Package Dependencies

```
optimizer ← (nothing, foundation)
wishocracy ← (nothing, standalone pure math)
opg ← optimizer
obg ← optimizer + opg
data ← optimizer
db ← data (curated seed/bootstrap catalogs only)
web ← everything
```

Key rules:
- **`optimizer` depends on NOTHING** — it's the foundation
- **Pure/browser-facing libraries must not gain runtime Prisma or database imports**
- **`db` exports pure TS interfaces** — libraries may import TYPE-ONLY exports (not Prisma client)
- **`db` may consume curated runtime catalogs from `data` when that removes duplicated source data**
- **No circular deps** — if you need something from both directions, it belongs in `optimizer`

### Type Sharing Strategy
The Prisma schema is the single source of truth. `@optimitron/db` exports:
1. **Pure TS interfaces** — for ALL packages (`import type { ... } from '@optimitron/db'`)
2. **Zod schemas** — for runtime validation (namespaced as `schemas`)
3. **Prisma client** — for web/API layer ONLY (never in library packages)

Libraries use `import type` (compile-time only, zero runtime cost, works in browser).
See `AGENTS.md` for full architectural rules.

### Prisma Version
We use **Prisma 7** (`prisma@^7.0.0`, `@prisma/client@^7.0.0`) with `@prisma/adapter-pg` for PostgreSQL. The `datasource` block in `schema.prisma` intentionally omits `url` — the connection is configured at runtime via the adapter. Do NOT add `url = env("DATABASE_URL")` to the datasource block.

## Page Metadata

`packages/web/src/lib/routes.ts` is the single source of truth for page titles and descriptions. Each `NavItem` has a `label`, `description`, and `emoji`. Pages use `getRouteMetadata(link)` from `packages/web/src/lib/metadata.ts` instead of hardcoding metadata. All descriptions are in Wishonia's voice.

## High-Value Defaults

1. **Test behavior, regressions, and non-trivial logic changes.** Do not require a bespoke test for every tiny wrapper.
2. **Run the relevant checks before committing.** Use `pnpm check` for broad changes; at minimum run the affected package build/test/lint surface.
3. **Library packages should stay runtime-safe.** Pure/browser-facing packages do not get Prisma or runtime DB imports.
4. **Use Zod where runtime validation protects a real boundary.** Do not cargo-cult it into every internal helper.
5. **When touching product UI, preserve the existing neobrutalist system unless you are intentionally changing the design direction.**

## Color Rules (Game Aesthetic — Dark Mode Default)

The UI uses a **dark-mode game aesthetic** with neobrutalist accents. Run `pnpm --filter @optimitron/web exec playwright test e2e/contrast-audit.spec.ts` to check contrast. See `docs/game-design-guidelines.md` for the full design system.

### Contrast Rule (CRITICAL)
- **Every `bg-brutal-*` element MUST set the matching `text-brutal-*-foreground`** on the same element
- **Children inside colored sections must NOT use `text-foreground` or `text-white`** — let them inherit the correct color from the parent
- `SectionContainer` and `BrutalCard` handle this automatically via their `bgColor` prop — use those instead of raw divs
- If you must use a raw div with `bg-brutal-yellow`, always pair it: `bg-brutal-yellow text-brutal-yellow-foreground`
- **Foreground tokens:** yellow=black, pink=black, cyan=black, red=black, green=black

### Approved Colors ONLY
- **Brutal tokens:** `brutal-pink`, `brutal-cyan`, `brutal-yellow`, `brutal-red`, `brutal-green` (and `-foreground` variants)
- **Semantic tokens:** `primary`, `foreground`, `background`, `muted`, `muted-foreground`, `primary-foreground`, `secondary`, `accent`, `destructive`, `border`, `card`, `popover`, `ring`, `input`, `chart-*`
- **Fundamentals:** `black`, `white`, `transparent`, `current`, `inherit` — only WITHOUT opacity modifiers
- **Hard shadows only:** `rgba(0,0,0,1)` — never soft/transparent shadows

### NEVER Use
- **Opacity modifiers on black/white:** `text-black/50`, `bg-white/70`, etc. → use `text-muted-foreground` or `text-foreground`
- **Hardcoded `bg-white`/`text-white`:** → use `bg-background`/`text-primary-foreground` (dark mode compat)
- **Hardcoded `bg-black`/`text-black`:** → use `bg-foreground`/`text-foreground` (dark mode compat)
- **Tailwind color scales:** `bg-emerald-100`, `text-gray-500`, etc. → use brutal-* or semantic tokens
- **Hardcoded hex colors:** `#ef4444`, `#666`, `#f5f5f5`, etc. → use CSS custom properties
- **Soft shadows:** `rgba(0,0,0,0.3)` → use `rgba(0,0,0,1)` for brutal hard shadows
- **Opacity on brutal tokens:** `bg-brutal-red/10`, `bg-brutal-yellow/20`, `bg-brutal-cyan/30` → creates washed-out pastels. Use the solid token or `bg-muted` instead. (Exception: `hover:bg-brutal-pink/80` for interactive darken is ok)
- **Exception:** Email templates (`emails/`) may use inline hex colors (email clients require it)

## Design Patterns (Neobrutalist)

The reference implementation is `E:\code\dih-neobrutalist`. When in doubt, check how dih-neobrutalist does it.

### Use the Primitives — Never Inline

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---|---|
| `<section className="bg-white py-24">` | `<SectionContainer bgColor="background">` |
| `<h2 className="text-3xl font-black uppercase">` | `<SectionHeader title="..." size="md" />` |
| `<div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">` | `<Container size="xl">` |
| Inline card with `border-4 border-black shadow-[...]` | `<BrutalCard bgColor="pink" shadowSize={8}>` |
| Inline stat block | `<StatCard value="$27B" label="Annual savings" color="cyan" />` |
| Inline CTA section | `<CTASection heading="..." bgColor="pink">` |
| Inline comparison layout | `<ComparisonCard left={...} right={...} />` |
| Inline numbered list item | `<NumberedStepCard step={1} title="..." description="..." />` |
| Manual stat grid | `<StatCardGrid stats={[...]} columns={3} />` |

### RetroUI Primitives (`packages/web/src/components/retroui/`)

  <Card.Content>Content</Card.Content>
</Card>
```

### Custom Domain Primitives (`packages/web/src/components/ui/`)

Project-specific components that wrap RetroUI primitives with domain styling.

| Component | File | Use For |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `StatCard` / `StatCardGrid` | `stat-card.tsx` | Single stat display with value, label, color; or a grid of them |
| `SectionHeader` | `section-header.tsx` | `h2` with subtitle, responsive sizing, centered by default |

| `CTASection` | `cta-section.tsx` | Full CTA section wrapper |
| `CheckmarkList` | `checkmark-list.tsx` | Bulleted list with checkmarks |
| `ParameterValue` | `../shared/ParameterValue.tsx` | Inline parameter display with hover popover (citations, LaTeX, confidence) |

### Border Weight
- **RetroUI components use `border-2`** — this is the default for all RetroUI primitives
- **Custom domain components (BrutalCard, SectionContainer) use `border-4 border-primary`** — for extra emphasis
- Never use `border-black` — use `border-primary` for dark mode compat

### Shadow Style
- **RetroUI components use `shadow-md`** which maps to hard offset shadows via CSS custom properties
- **Custom components** use explicit `shadow-[8px_8px_0px_0px_rgba(0,0,0,1)]` where RetroUI tokens don't apply
- Never soft: no `rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`

### Hover Behavior
- **RetroUI buttons:** push-down on hover (`hover:translate-y-1 active:translate-y-2`) — shadow shrinks
- **Custom cards (BrutalCard):** hover-OUT (shadow grows, card lifts UP) — `hover:translate-x-[-2px] hover:translate-y-[-2px]`
- Both patterns are valid — RetroUI for standard interactions, hover-OUT for featured cards

### Typography
- **Headings:** `font-black uppercase` always
- **Body:** `font-bold` (700) minimum — never `font-medium` (500) or `font-normal` (400)
- **Subtle text:** `text-muted-foreground font-bold` — not `text-black/50 font-medium`
- **Sizes:** Use the responsive scale from `SectionHeader` (e.g., `text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl`)

### Color Usage
- **Section backgrounds** alternate between brutal tokens: `bg-brutal-pink`, `bg-brutal-cyan`, `bg-brutal-yellow`, `bg-foreground`
- **Text on colored backgrounds:** use the foreground variant or `text-foreground`/`text-background`
- **Accent text inline:** `<span className="text-brutal-pink">` or `<span className="bg-brutal-cyan px-2">` (highlighted)

### Do NOT Use
- `rounded-xl`, `rounded-2xl` — keep `rounded-md` or `rounded-none` for brutal feel
- `shadow-sm`, `shadow-lg` — use `shadow-md` (RetroUI default) or explicit hard offset shadows
- `font-normal`, `font-medium`, `font-light` — too soft for neobrutalist
- `bg-gray-50`, `bg-gray-100`, etc. — use `bg-muted` or `bg-background`
- Gradients (`bg-gradient-to-*`) — flat colors only

## Tooling

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces
- **Tests**: vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (e2e in web)
- **Web**: Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS 4, RetroUI + Radix UI, next-auth + WorldID
- **Contracts**: Hardhat 2.22, OpenZeppelin 5.1, Solidity 0.8.24
- **CI**: GitHub Actions (typecheck + lint + test on push/PR; web excluded — Vercel handles it)

## Type Safety & Linting

Before committing, always run:
```bash
pnpm check    # runs: typecheck + lint + test
```

The tsc config can't be invoked directly on a single file due to jsx/alias issues — need to use the project-level pnpm typecheck.

- **TypeScript strict mode** is ON (noUncheckedIndexedAccess, noImplicitOverride)
- **ESLint** uses typescript-eslint strict rules
- **No `any`** — use proper types or `unknown` with type guards
- **No floating promises** — always await or void
- **No unused variables** — prefix with `_` if intentionally unused
- **All tsconfigs extend `tsconfig.base.json`** — don't override strict settings

## Self-Review: Be Ruthlessly Critical

Every run, before picking a new task, scan the codebase with fresh eyes:

### Code Smells to Fix Immediately
- **Dead code**: Unused imports, unreachable branches, commented-out code → delete it
- **Copy-paste**: Same logic in multiple places → extract to shared function
- **Over-engineering**: Abstract base classes nobody extends, factories that create one thing → simplify
- **Wrong abstractions**: If a function takes 8 parameters, it's doing too much → split it
- **Magic numbers**: Unexplained constants → named constants citing the paper
- **Stale TODOs**: TODO comments with no plan → either do it or delete it

### The Simplicity Test
**"Could a junior developer understand this in 30 seconds?"**
If not, simplify it. This should not feel like enterprise Java.

### What Good Looks Like
- Functions usually fit on one screen
- Files stay reviewable; treat 30/300 as smell thresholds, not hard caps
- Module names tell you exactly what's inside
- Tests read like documentation
- No unnecessary abstractions — just functions that take data and return results
