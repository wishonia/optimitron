/**
 * @title PoliticalIncentiveAllocator
 * @notice Receives the 10% political incentive allocation from IABSplitter
 *         and distributes stablecoins to politician campaign wallets
 *         proportional to their Citizen Alignment Scores (CAS).
 *
 * How it works:
 *   1. IABSplitter sends 10% of IAB yield here
 *   2. Owner registers politicians with verified campaign wallets
 *   3. Anyone can trigger allocate() with Merkle proofs of CAS scores
 *   4. Contract verifies each score against AlignmentScoreOracle
 *   5. Politicians below minimumAlignmentScore get zero
 *   6. Funds distributed proportional to (score - minimum) for qualified politicians
 *
 * This creates a direct financial incentive for politicians to align
 * their votes with citizen preferences. No middleman, no PAC — just math.
