## Quick Meanings

- `Recommended level`: main value to try first.
- `Data-backed level`: level directly supported by seen data.
- `Backup level`: safer fallback from the middle of the data.
- `Math-only guess`: unconstrained model output for technical comparison.
- `Not enough data`: we cannot safely recommend a level yet.

## Key Numeric Takeaways

- Recommended Government Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) level for higher Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE): 16474.4 international $/person (data-backed level).
- Best level directly seen in the grouped data: 16474.4 international $/person.
- Math-only guess is inside seen data but outside the best-performing bucket, so we still use the data-backed level.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 15541.4 international $/person; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is -10467.3 (-67.4%).
- Backup level check (middle 10-90% of data) suggests 10258.3 international $/person.
- The math-only guess and backup level differ by 102.2%, which means extreme values may matter a lot.
- Minimum effective level (first consistently positive zone): 302.76 international $/person.
- Diminishing returns likely begin near 596.04 international $/person.
- Saturation/plateau zone starts around 4796.0 international $/person and extends through 16474.4 international $/person.
- Highest observed mean Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) appears when Government Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) is in [12137.9, 43487.5] (mean outcome 68.988).
- Direction is positive in this analysis, so increasing this predictor is associated with better outcomes.

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Stronger signal compared with most other predictors in this report.
- Pattern hint: higher Government Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) tends to go with better Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- Signal strength: stronger in this report set.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Government Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) tends to align with better Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- The estimate uses 147 subjects and 9702 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [12137.9, 43487.5] (mean outcome 68.988).
- A minimum effective predictor level appears near 302.76 international $/person in the binned response curve.
- Confidence score is 0.690 (medium confidence); data status is enough data.
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Forward and direction signals disagree; direction may be unstable.
- Some country-level direction scores are unusually high; this can happen with this scoring method.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0019); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 102.2% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
