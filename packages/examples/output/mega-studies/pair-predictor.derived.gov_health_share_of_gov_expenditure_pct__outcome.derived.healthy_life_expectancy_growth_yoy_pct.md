- Temporal candidates evaluated: 15
- Temporal candidates with valid results: 15
- Temporal profile score: 0.4258
- Included subjects: 141
- Skipped subjects: 0

## Actionable Takeaway

- Exploratory estimate of best Government Health Share of Government Spending level for higher Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %): 13.024 % of government expenditure.
- Model-derived optimum is within observed support but outside the highest-outcome bin; this reflects smooth objective optimization vs coarse bin averages.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 4.793 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is 8.231 (+171.7%).
- Robust sensitivity (trimmed 10-90% predictor range) suggests 14.852 % of government expenditure.
- Highest observed mean Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %) appears when Government Health Share of Government Spending is in [0.93053, 5.930) (mean outcome 0.57112).
- Direction is negative in this analysis, so lowering this predictor is associated with better outcomes.
- Actionability gate: exploratory only (aggregate significance below actionable threshold (<0.80); temporal-profile selection is unstable).

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Exploratory evidence only; use primarily for hypothesis generation.
- Practical direction: exploratory signal only; do not treat this as a prescriptive target yet.
- Signal strength: moderate-to-weak; avoid hard policy conclusions from this pair alone.
- Actionability status: exploratory.
- Actionability gate reasons: aggregate significance below actionable threshold (<0.80); temporal-profile selection is unstable.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Government Health Share of Government Spending tends to align with worse Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %).
- The estimate uses 141 subjects and 2961 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [0.93053, 5.930) (mean outcome 0.57112).
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Weak aggregate significance (<0.70).
- Some subject-level directional scores exceed |1|; this is valid because the score is a difference of two correlations.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0241); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
