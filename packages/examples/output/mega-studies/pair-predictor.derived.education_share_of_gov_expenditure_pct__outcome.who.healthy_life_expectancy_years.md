## Actionable Takeaway

- Exploratory estimate of best Education Share of Government Spending level for higher Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE): 19.742 % of government expenditure.
- Model-derived optimum is within observed support but outside the highest-outcome bin; this reflects smooth objective optimization vs coarse bin averages.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 13.815 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is 5.928 (+42.9%).
- Robust sensitivity (trimmed 10-90% predictor range) suggests 14.703 % of government expenditure.
- Raw vs robust optimal differs by 25.5%, indicating strong tail influence.
- Highest observed mean Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) appears when Education Share of Government Spending is in [12.846, 14.703) (mean outcome 65.740).
- Direction is positive in this analysis, so increasing this predictor is associated with better outcomes.
- Actionability gate: exploratory only (temporal-profile selection is unstable).

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Stronger evidence for directional signal relative to other predictors in this report.
- Practical direction: exploratory signal only; do not treat this as a prescriptive target yet.
- Signal strength: relatively stronger within this report set.
- Actionability status: exploratory.
- Actionability gate reasons: temporal-profile selection is unstable.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Education Share of Government Spending tends to align with better Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- The estimate uses 134 subjects and 8844 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [12.846, 14.703) (mean outcome 65.740).
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Some subject-level directional scores exceed |1|; this is valid because the score is a difference of two correlations.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0162); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 25.5% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
