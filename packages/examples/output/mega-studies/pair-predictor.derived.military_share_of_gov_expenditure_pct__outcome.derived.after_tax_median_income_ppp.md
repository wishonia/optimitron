## Actionable Takeaway

- Exploratory estimate of best Military Share of Government Spending level for higher After-Tax Median Income (PPP): 8.164 % of government expenditure.
- Model-derived optimum is within observed support but outside the highest-outcome bin; this reflects smooth objective optimization vs coarse bin averages.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 3.627 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is 4.537 (+125.1%).
- Robust sensitivity (trimmed 10-90% predictor range) suggests 3.573 % of government expenditure.
- Raw vs robust optimal differs by 56.2%, indicating strong tail influence.
- Highest observed mean After-Tax Median Income (PPP) appears when Military Share of Government Spending is in [3.111, 4.156) (mean outcome 27010.6).
- Direction is negative in this analysis, so lowering this predictor is associated with better outcomes.
- Actionability gate: exploratory only (temporal-profile selection is unstable).

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Moderate evidence; plausible signal but still sensitive to model assumptions.
- Practical direction: exploratory signal only; do not treat this as a prescriptive target yet.
- Signal strength: relatively stronger within this report set.
- Actionability status: exploratory.
- Actionability gate reasons: temporal-profile selection is unstable.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Military Share of Government Spending tends to align with worse After-Tax Median Income (PPP).
- The estimate uses 148 subjects and 5001 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [3.111, 4.156) (mean outcome 27010.6).
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Some subject-level directional scores exceed |1|; this is valid because the score is a difference of two correlations.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0133); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 56.2% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
