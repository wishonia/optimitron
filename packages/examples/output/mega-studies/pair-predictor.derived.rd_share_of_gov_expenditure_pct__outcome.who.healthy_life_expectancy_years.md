## Quick Meanings

- `Recommended level`: main value to try first.
- `Data-backed level`: level directly supported by seen data.
- `Backup level`: safer fallback from the middle of the data.
- `Math-only guess`: unconstrained model output for technical comparison.
- `Not enough data`: we cannot safely recommend a level yet.

## Key Numeric Takeaways

- Recommended R&D Share of Government Spending level for higher Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE): 13.185 % of government expenditure (data-backed level).
- Best level directly seen in the grouped data: 13.185 % of government expenditure.
- Math-only guess is inside seen data but outside the best-performing bucket, so we still use the data-backed level.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 12.605 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is -8.785 (-69.7%).
- Backup level check (middle 10-90% of data) suggests 7.223 % of government expenditure.
- The math-only guess and backup level differ by 89.1%, which means extreme values may matter a lot.
- Minimum effective level (first consistently positive zone): 4.042 % of government expenditure.
- Could not find a clear point where gains start slowing down (drop_below_detection_threshold).
- Could not find a stable flat zone (no_plateau_zone_detected).
- Highest observed mean Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) appears when R&D Share of Government Spending is in [9.390, 20.356] (mean outcome 69.965).
- Direction is positive in this analysis, so increasing this predictor is associated with better outcomes.

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Medium signal; still sensitive to model choices.
- Pattern hint: higher R&D Share of Government Spending tends to go with better Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- Signal strength: stronger in this report set.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher R&D Share of Government Spending tends to align with better Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- The estimate uses 82 subjects and 5412 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [9.390, 20.356] (mean outcome 69.965).
- A minimum effective predictor level appears near 4.042 % of government expenditure in the binned response curve.
- Confidence score is 0.749 (medium confidence); data status is enough data.
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Some country-level direction scores are unusually high; this can happen with this scoring method.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 89.1% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
