## Quick Meanings

- `Recommended level`: main value to try first.
- `Data-backed level`: level directly supported by seen data.
- `Backup level`: safer fallback from the middle of the data.
- `Math-only guess`: unconstrained model output for technical comparison.
- `Not enough data`: we cannot safely recommend a level yet.

## Key Numeric Takeaways

- Recommended R&D Share of Government Spending level for higher After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %): 1.498 % of government expenditure (data-backed level).
- Best level directly seen in the grouped data: 1.498 % of government expenditure.
- Math-only guess is inside seen data but outside the best-performing bucket, so we still use the data-backed level.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 1.786 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is 1.924 (+107.7%).
- Backup level check (middle 10-90% of data) suggests 1.513 % of government expenditure.
- The math-only guess and backup level differ by 59.2%, which means extreme values may matter a lot.
- Could not find a clear minimum useful level (no_consistent_effective_dose_detected).
- Diminishing returns likely begin near 1.498 % of government expenditure.
- Could not find a stable flat zone (no_plateau_zone_detected).
- Highest observed mean After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %) appears when R&D Share of Government Spending is in [1.523, 2.042) (mean outcome 5.853).
- Direction is positive in this analysis, so increasing this predictor is associated with better outcomes.

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Early signal only; use this mainly to guide more testing.
- Pattern hint: higher R&D Share of Government Spending tends to go with better After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %).
- Signal strength: weak to moderate; avoid strong conclusions from this pair alone.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher R&D Share of Government Spending tends to align with better After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %).
- The estimate uses 100 subjects and 3280 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [1.523, 2.042) (mean outcome 5.853).
- Confidence score is 0.578 (medium confidence); data status is enough data.
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Some country-level direction scores are unusually high; this can happen with this scoring method.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0094); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 59.2% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
