## Quick Meanings

- `Recommended level`: main value to try first.
- `Data-backed level`: level directly supported by seen data.
- `Backup level`: safer fallback from the middle of the data.
- `Math-only guess`: unconstrained model output for technical comparison.
- `Not enough data`: we cannot safely recommend a level yet.

## Key Numeric Takeaways

- Recommended R&D Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) level for higher Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE): 1356.1 international $/person (data-backed level).
- Best level directly seen in the grouped data: 1356.1 international $/person.
- Math-only guess is inside seen data but outside the best-performing bucket, so we still use the data-backed level.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 1302.4 international $/person; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is -953.35 (-73.2%).
- Backup level check (middle 10-90% of data) suggests 805.20 international $/person.
- The math-only guess and backup level differ by 130.7%, which means extreme values may matter a lot.
- Minimum effective level (first consistently positive zone): 5.168 international $/person.
- Diminishing returns likely begin near 12.003 international $/person.
- Saturation/plateau zone starts around 290.74 international $/person and extends through 1356.1 international $/person.
- Highest observed mean Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) appears when R&D Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) is in [984.07, 2227.7] (mean outcome 70.299).
- Direction is positive in this analysis, so increasing this predictor is associated with better outcomes.

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Medium signal; still sensitive to model choices.
- Pattern hint: higher R&D Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) tends to go with better Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- Signal strength: stronger in this report set.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher R&D Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) tends to align with better Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- The estimate uses 95 subjects and 6270 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [984.07, 2227.7] (mean outcome 70.299).
- A minimum effective predictor level appears near 5.168 international $/person in the binned response curve.
- Confidence score is 0.658 (medium confidence); data status is enough data.
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Forward and direction signals disagree; direction may be unstable.
- Some country-level direction scores are unusually high; this can happen with this scoring method.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0040); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 130.7% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
