## Quick Meanings

- `Recommended level`: main value to try first.
- `Data-backed level`: level directly supported by seen data.
- `Backup level`: safer fallback from the middle of the data.
- `Math-only guess`: unconstrained model output for technical comparison.
- `Not enough data`: we cannot safely recommend a level yet.

## Key Numeric Takeaways

- Recommended Military Share of Government Spending level for higher Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE): 3.773 % of government expenditure (data-backed level).
- Best level directly seen in the grouped data: 3.773 % of government expenditure.
- Math-only guess is inside seen data but outside the best-performing bucket, so we still use the data-backed level.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 3.317 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is 4.918 (+148.3%).
- Backup level check (middle 10-90% of data) suggests 3.213 % of government expenditure.
- The math-only guess and backup level differ by 61.0%, which means extreme values may matter a lot.
- Could not find a clear minimum useful level (no_consistent_effective_dose_detected).
- Diminishing returns likely begin near 3.773 % of government expenditure.
- Could not find a stable flat zone (no_plateau_zone_detected).
- Highest observed mean Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) appears when Military Share of Government Spending is in [2.653, 3.717) (mean outcome 65.359).
- Direction is negative in this analysis, so lowering this predictor is associated with better outcomes.

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Stronger signal compared with most other predictors in this report.
- Pattern hint: lower Military Share of Government Spending tends to go with better Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- Signal strength: stronger in this report set.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Military Share of Government Spending tends to align with worse Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- The estimate uses 126 subjects and 8316 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [2.653, 3.717) (mean outcome 65.359).
- Confidence score is 0.642 (medium confidence); data status is enough data.
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Some country-level direction scores are unusually high; this can happen with this scoring method.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0149); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 61.0% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
