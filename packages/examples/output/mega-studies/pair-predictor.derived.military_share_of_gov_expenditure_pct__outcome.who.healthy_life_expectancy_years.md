- Lag years: 3
- Duration years: 3
- Temporal profile source: predictor_default
- Filling strategy: interpolation
- Temporal candidates evaluated: 12
- Temporal candidates with valid results: 12
- Temporal profile score: 0.6039
- Included subjects: 126
- Skipped subjects: 0
- Total aligned pairs: 8316
- Evidence grade: A
- Quality tier: exploratory
- Direction: negative
- Derived uncertainty score: 0.0792 (1 - aggregate significance, not NHST p-value)

## Actionable Takeaway

- Exploratory estimate of best Military Share of Government Spending level for higher Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE): 8.235 % of government expenditure.
- Model-derived optimum is within observed support but outside the highest-outcome bin; this reflects smooth objective optimization vs coarse bin averages.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 3.317 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is 4.918 (+148.3%).
- Robust sensitivity (trimmed 10-90% predictor range) suggests 3.213 % of government expenditure.
- Raw vs robust optimal differs by 61.0%, indicating strong tail influence.
- Highest observed mean Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) appears when Military Share of Government Spending is in [2.653, 3.717) (mean outcome 65.359).
- Direction is negative in this analysis, so lowering this predictor is associated with better outcomes.
- Actionability gate: exploratory only (temporal-profile selection is unstable).

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Stronger evidence for directional signal relative to other predictors in this report.
- Practical direction: exploratory signal only; do not treat this as a prescriptive target yet.
- Signal strength: relatively stronger within this report set.
- Actionability status: exploratory.
- Actionability gate reasons: temporal-profile selection is unstable.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Military Share of Government Spending tends to align with worse Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- The estimate uses 126 subjects and 8316 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [2.653, 3.717) (mean outcome 65.359).
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Some subject-level directional scores exceed |1|; this is valid because the score is a difference of two correlations.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0149); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 61.0% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
