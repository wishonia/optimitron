## Quick Meanings

- `Recommended level`: main value to try first.
- `Data-backed level`: level directly supported by seen data.
- `Backup level`: safer fallback from the middle of the data.
- `Math-only guess`: unconstrained model output for technical comparison.
- `Not enough data`: we cannot safely recommend a level yet.

## Key Numeric Takeaways

- Recommended Education Share of Government Spending level for higher After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %): 13.129 % of government expenditure (data-backed level).
- Best level directly seen in the grouped data: 13.129 % of government expenditure.
- Math-only guess is inside seen data but outside the best-performing bucket, so we still use the data-backed level.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 13.796 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is 5.240 (+38.0%).
- Backup level check (middle 10-90% of data) suggests 13.288 % of government expenditure.
- The math-only guess and backup level differ by 30.2%, which means extreme values may matter a lot.
- Could not find a clear minimum useful level (no_consistent_effective_dose_detected).
- Diminishing returns likely begin near 13.129 % of government expenditure.
- Saturation/plateau zone starts around 16.371 % of government expenditure and extends through 17.804 % of government expenditure.
- Highest observed mean After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %) appears when Education Share of Government Spending is in [12.937, 14.674) (mean outcome 5.598).
- Direction signal is neutral; use caution and rely on the data-backed level.

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Early signal only; use this mainly to guide more testing.
- Pattern hint: no clear up/down pattern; use data-backed levels only.
- Signal strength: weak to moderate; avoid strong conclusions from this pair alone.

## Plain-Language Summary

- No strong directional pattern is detected between Education Share of Government Spending and After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %).
- The estimate uses 159 subjects and 5212 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [12.937, 14.674) (mean outcome 5.598).
- Confidence score is 0.730 (medium confidence); data status is enough data.
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Weak significance score (<0.70).
- Some country-level direction scores are unusually high; this can happen with this scoring method.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0064); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 30.2% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
