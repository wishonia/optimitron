## Quick Meanings

- `Recommended level`: main value to try first.
- `Data-backed level`: level directly supported by seen data.
- `Backup level`: safer fallback from the middle of the data.
- `Math-only guess`: unconstrained model output for technical comparison.
- `Not enough data`: we cannot safely recommend a level yet.

## Key Numeric Takeaways

- Recommended Government Health Share of Government Spending level for higher After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %): 12.642 % of government expenditure (data-backed level).
- Best level directly seen in the grouped data: 12.642 % of government expenditure.
- Backup level check (middle 10-90% of data) suggests 12.600 % of government expenditure.
- Could not find a clear minimum useful level (no_consistent_effective_dose_detected).
- Diminishing returns likely begin near 12.642 % of government expenditure.
- Saturation/plateau zone starts around 14.970 % of government expenditure and extends through 27.065 % of government expenditure.
- Highest observed mean After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %) appears when Government Health Share of Government Spending is in [12.186, 13.363) (mean outcome 5.778).
- Direction is positive in this analysis, so increasing this predictor is associated with better outcomes.

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Early signal only; use this mainly to guide more testing.
- Pattern hint: higher Government Health Share of Government Spending tends to go with better After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %).
- Signal strength: weak to moderate; avoid strong conclusions from this pair alone.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Government Health Share of Government Spending tends to align with better After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %).
- The estimate uses 168 subjects and 5509 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [12.186, 13.363) (mean outcome 5.778).
- Confidence score is 0.882 (higher confidence); data status is enough data.
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Weak significance score (<0.70).
- Some country-level direction scores are unusually high; this can happen with this scoring method.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0298); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
