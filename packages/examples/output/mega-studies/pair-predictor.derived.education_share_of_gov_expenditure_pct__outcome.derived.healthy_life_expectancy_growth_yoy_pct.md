## Quick Meanings

- `Recommended level`: main value to try first.
- `Data-backed level`: level directly supported by seen data.
- `Backup level`: safer fallback from the middle of the data.
- `Math-only guess`: unconstrained model output for technical comparison.
- `Not enough data`: we cannot safely recommend a level yet.

## Key Numeric Takeaways

- Recommended Education Share of Government Spending level for higher Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %): 33.378 % of government expenditure (data-backed level).
- Best level directly seen in the grouped data: 33.378 % of government expenditure.
- Math-only guess is inside seen data but outside the best-performing bucket, so we still use the data-backed level.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 32.305 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is -12.865 (-39.8%).
- Backup level check (middle 10-90% of data) suggests 20.911 % of government expenditure.
- Minimum effective level (first consistently positive zone): 19.592 % of government expenditure.
- Diminishing returns likely begin near 21.063 % of government expenditure.
- Could not find a stable flat zone (no_plateau_zone_detected).
- Highest observed mean Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %) appears when Education Share of Government Spending is in [28.681, 66.668] (mean outcome 0.72663).
- Direction is positive in this analysis, so increasing this predictor is associated with better outcomes.

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Early signal only; use this mainly to guide more testing.
- Pattern hint: higher Education Share of Government Spending tends to go with better Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %).
- Signal strength: weak to moderate; avoid strong conclusions from this pair alone.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Education Share of Government Spending tends to align with better Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %).
- The estimate uses 134 subjects and 2814 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [28.681, 66.668] (mean outcome 0.72663).
- A minimum effective predictor level appears near 19.592 % of government expenditure in the binned response curve.
- Confidence score is 0.508 (lower confidence); data status is enough data.
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Weak significance score (<0.70).
- Some country-level direction scores are unusually high; this can happen with this scoring method.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0112); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
