- Derived uncertainty score: 0.0830 (1 - aggregate significance, not NHST p-value)

## Actionable Takeaway

- Exploratory estimate of best Government Health Share of Government Spending level for higher Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE): 13.614 % of government expenditure.
- Model-derived optimum is within observed support but outside the highest-outcome bin; this reflects smooth objective optimization vs coarse bin averages.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 25.736 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is -12.122 (-47.1%).
- Robust sensitivity (trimmed 10-90% predictor range) suggests 19.044 % of government expenditure.
- Raw vs robust optimal differs by 39.9%, indicating strong tail influence.
- Highest observed mean Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) appears when Government Health Share of Government Spending is in [20.671, 66.811] (mean outcome 67.739).
- Direction is negative in this analysis, so lowering this predictor is associated with better outcomes.
- Actionability gate: exploratory only (temporal-profile selection is unstable).

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Stronger evidence for directional signal relative to other predictors in this report.
- Practical direction: exploratory signal only; do not treat this as a prescriptive target yet.
- Signal strength: relatively stronger within this report set.
- Actionability status: exploratory.
- Actionability gate reasons: temporal-profile selection is unstable.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Government Health Share of Government Spending tends to align with worse Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE).
- The estimate uses 141 subjects and 9306 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [20.671, 66.811] (mean outcome 67.739).
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Some subject-level directional scores exceed |1|; this is valid because the score is a difference of two correlations.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0029); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 39.9% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
