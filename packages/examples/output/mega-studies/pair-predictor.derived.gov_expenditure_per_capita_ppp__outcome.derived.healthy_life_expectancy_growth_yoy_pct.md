## Quick Meanings

- `Recommended level`: main value to try first.
- `Data-backed level`: level directly supported by seen data.
- `Backup level`: safer fallback from the middle of the data.
- `Math-only guess`: unconstrained model output for technical comparison.
- `Not enough data`: we cannot safely recommend a level yet.

## Key Numeric Takeaways

- Recommended Government Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) level for higher Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %): 138.29 international $/person (data-backed level).
- Best level directly seen in the grouped data: 138.29 international $/person.
- Math-only guess is inside seen data but outside the best-performing bucket, so we still use the data-backed level.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 162.53 international $/person; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is 4369.0 (+2688.1%).
- Backup level check (middle 10-90% of data) suggests 716.19 international $/person.
- The math-only guess and backup level differ by 84.2%, which means extreme values may matter a lot.
- Could not find a clear minimum useful level (no_consistent_effective_dose_detected).
- Could not find a clear point where gains start slowing down (drop_below_detection_threshold).
- Saturation/plateau zone starts around 8422.5 international $/person and extends through 17825.6 international $/person.
- Highest observed mean Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %) appears when Government Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) is in [20.664, 260.72) (mean outcome 1.070).
- Direction is negative in this analysis, so lowering this predictor is associated with better outcomes.

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Early signal only; use this mainly to guide more testing.
- Pattern hint: lower Government Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) tends to go with better Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %).
- Signal strength: weak to moderate; avoid strong conclusions from this pair alone.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Government Expenditure Per Capita (PPP) tends to align with worse Healthy Life Expectancy Growth (YoY %).
- The estimate uses 147 subjects and 3087 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [20.664, 260.72) (mean outcome 1.070).
- Confidence score is 0.407 (lower confidence); data status is enough data.
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Weak significance score (<0.70).
- Forward and direction signals disagree; direction may be unstable.
- Some country-level direction scores are unusually high; this can happen with this scoring method.
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0126); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 84.2% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
