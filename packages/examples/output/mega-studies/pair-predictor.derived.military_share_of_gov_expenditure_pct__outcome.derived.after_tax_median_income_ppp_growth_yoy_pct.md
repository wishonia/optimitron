## Actionable Takeaway

- Exploratory estimate of best Military Share of Government Spending level for higher After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %): 9.785 % of government expenditure.
- Model-derived optimum is within observed support but outside the highest-outcome bin; this reflects smooth objective optimization vs coarse bin averages.
- Best observed bin anchor (median/mean) is 5.208 % of government expenditure; model-optimal minus observed-anchor difference is 4.577 (+87.9%).
- Robust sensitivity (trimmed 10-90% predictor range) suggests 4.759 % of government expenditure.
- Raw vs robust optimal differs by 51.4%, indicating strong tail influence.
- Highest observed mean After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %) appears when Military Share of Government Spending is in [4.760, 5.660) (mean outcome 5.170).
- Direction is negative in this analysis, so lowering this predictor is associated with better outcomes.
- Actionability gate: exploratory only (aggregate significance below actionable threshold (<0.80); temporal-profile selection is unstable).

## Decision Summary

- Interpretation: Exploratory evidence only; use primarily for hypothesis generation.
- Practical direction: exploratory signal only; do not treat this as a prescriptive target yet.
- Signal strength: moderate-to-weak; avoid hard policy conclusions from this pair alone.
- Actionability status: exploratory.
- Actionability gate reasons: aggregate significance below actionable threshold (<0.80); temporal-profile selection is unstable.

## Plain-Language Summary

- Higher Military Share of Government Spending tends to align with worse After-Tax Median Income Growth (YoY %).
- The estimate uses 148 subjects and 4853 aligned predictor-outcome observations.
- Best observed mean outcome appears in predictor bin [4.760, 5.660) (mean outcome 5.170).
- Outcome values in these summaries are welfare-aligned for cross-metric comparison (higher means better).

## Quality Warnings

- Weak aggregate significance (<0.70).
- Top temporal profiles are close (score delta 0.0223); temporal assumptions are not yet robust.
- Robustness check: trimmed-range optimal differs by 51.4% from raw optimal; tail observations materially influence target.
