/**
 * Canonical US Wishocratic item catalog shared by dataset consumers and DB seeds.
 *
 * US Citizen Priority Items
 *
 * The 18 budget priority categories that citizens compare via RAPPA
 * (pairwise allocation). Each item includes:
 * - Structural data: spending, ROI, fiscal category mappings
 * - Voice: Wishonia's deadpan descriptions with source citations
 * - Mappings: which fiscal categories (from us-federal-budget.ts) this maps to
 *
 * These are more granular and opinionated than the 23 OMB fiscal categories.
 * A priority item may be a subset of a fiscal category (Nuclear Weapons ⊂ Military),
 * span multiple (Drug War → Justice + Homeland Security), or represent proposed
 * spending that doesn't exist yet (UBI).
