/**
 * Politician Scorecards — based on ACTUAL budget votes, not hypothetical allocations.
 *
 * The key metric: for every dollar of clinical trial funding a politician voted for,
 * how many dollars of military spending did they also vote for?
 *
 * The US system-wide ratio is 1,094:1 ($886B military / $810M clinical trials).
 * Any politician who votes YEA on both the NDAA and NIH funding gets that ratio.
 * The only way to improve it is to vote AGAINST military spending increases
 * or vote FOR clinical trial funding increases.
