# Aggregated N-of-1 Raw Data (Drug Enforcement)

This folder contains the downloaded source files needed for a cross-jurisdiction
aggregated N-of-1 analysis of drug-enforcement spending vs overdose-like outcomes.

## Files

## Derived Metrics

In `derived-drug-war-proxy-panel.csv`:

- `publicOrderSafetySpendingPctGdp`
  - `100 * publicOrderSafetySpendingLcu / gdpCurrentLcu`
- `publicOrderSafetySpendingPerCapitaPpp`
  - `(publicOrderSafetySpendingPctGdp / 100) * gdpPerCapitaPppCurrent`

In `derived-drug-enforcement-panel.csv`:

- `drugTraffickingArrestShare`
  - `drugTraffickingArrestsCount / totalArrestsCount`
- `drugLawArrestShare`
  - `(drugTraffickingArrestsCount + drugPossessionArrestsCount) / totalArrestsCount`
- `estimatedDrugTraffickingEnforcementSpendingPerCapitaPpp`
  - `publicOrderSafetySpendingPerCapitaPpp * drugTraffickingArrestShare`
- `estimatedDrugLawEnforcementSpendingPerCapitaPpp`
  - `publicOrderSafetySpendingPerCapitaPpp * drugLawArrestShare`

## Important Caveats

- Base spending still comes from `GF03` (public order and safety), but the primary predictor now weights this by UNODC drug-arrest shares to approximate drug-enforcement allocation.
- Estimated predictors are allocation proxies, not audited country ledger totals for narcotics enforcement budgets.
- OECD outcome (`CICDPOSN`) is accidental poisoning mortality, which is overdose-adjacent but not a pure drug-overdose series.
- World Bank poisoning mortality (`SH.STA.POIS.P5`) has broader jurisdiction coverage but is also not opioid-specific.
- This panel is suitable for immediate aggregated N-of-1 prototyping, but direct audited country-year drug-enforcement expenditure remains a priority data gap.
