Slot 2 (1% Treaty) actively brightens — parks bloom with green pixels, hospital lights turn on, pixel people stand taller, $15.7M CountUps from $0 in golden text, ◄◄◄ arrow pulses. Slot 3 (Wishonia Trajectory) gleams impossibly — the Wishonia paradise rendered in miniature, every pixel radiating, $54.3M in white-gold.
