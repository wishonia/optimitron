/**
 * Modular demo segment library + named playlists.
 *
 * Each segment is a standalone 30-90s narrated piece covering one concept.
 * Playlists compose segments into different video outputs:
 *   - hackathon (3 min)
 *   - full-demo (7-8 min)
 *   - investor-pitch (5 min)
 *   - youtube-[feature] (1-2 min each)
 *   - social-[hook] (30-60s each)
 *
 * The /demo page takes ?playlist=hackathon to select which version to play.

Everyone at the poverty line, no bureaucracy. Three: monetary policy.

Decentralized clinical trials, smart contracts, causal inference engines, immutable storage, algorithmic governance — who is going to build all of this? The answer: you do not need to know. Nobody knows how to make a pencil. Not one person on Earth. The wood comes from one country, the graphite from another, the rubber from a third, the paint from a fourth. Millions of people each doing one tiny step. No one coordinates them. The price system does. That is what the prize pool is. Four billion people, each with Vote Points worth one hundred and ninety-four thousand dollars, will figure out how to build a decentralized FDA the same way they figured out how to build a pencil. You do not need a plan. You need an incentive. The incentive is seven hundred and seventy-four trillion dollars. And the game does not pick which solution wins. Researcher discovers cheaper trials? Gets paid. Lobbyist passes legislation? Gets paid. Nonprofit gets a million people to play? Gets paid. Every approach competes. The best ones get funded. That is not central planning.
