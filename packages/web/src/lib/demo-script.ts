/**
 * Modular demo segment library + named playlists.
 *
 * Each segment is a standalone 30-90s narrated piece covering one concept.
 * Playlists compose segments into different video outputs:
 *   - hackathon (3 min)
 *   - full-demo (7-8 min)
 *   - investor-pitch (5 min)
 *   - youtube-[feature] (1-2 min each)
 *   - social-[hook] (30-60s each)
 *
 * The /demo page takes ?playlist=hackathon to select which version to play.
