/**
 * Modular demo segment library + named playlists.
 *
 * Each segment is a standalone 30-90s narrated piece covering one concept.
 * Playlists compose segments into different video outputs:
 *   - hackathon (3 min)
 *   - full-demo (7-8 min)
 *   - investor-pitch (5 min)
 *   - youtube-[feature] (1-2 min each)
 *   - social-[hook] (30-60s each)
 *
 * The /demo page takes ?playlist=hackathon to select which version to play.

    tags: ["hook", "problem"],
    narration: `${deathsDaily} people die every day from treatable diseases. Your governments spend ${milToTrialRatio} dollars on weapons and military systems for every one dollar they spend on clinical trials. That is not a policy disagreement. That is a configuration error in a collective intelligence system controlling eight billion lives.`,

    id: "hook-misaligned-ai",
    title: "Misaligned Superintelligences",
    componentId: "hook",
    bgColor: "foreground",
    tags: ["hook", "problem"],
    narration: `Your governments are misaligned superintelligences — collective intelligence systems optimising for re-election instead of welfare. Same problem as any misaligned AI, except these ones have nuclear weapons and a trillion-dollar budget. I built alignment software. It works on my planet. Let us see if your species can handle it.`,

    title: "The $101 Trillion Bug",
    componentId: "hook",
    bgColor: "foreground",

    narration: `Your governments cost you ${dysfunctionCostT} trillion dollars a year in dysfunction. That is ${dysfunctionPerPerson} per person, per year. Every person. Including the ones who cannot afford lunch. On my planet, when a system kills ${deathsDaily} people a day and costs ${dysfunctionCostT} trillion a year, we do not call it politics. We call it a bug. And we fix it.`,

    id: "hook-parasitic-economy",
    title: "The Collapse Clock",

    narration: `The parasitic economy — military spending plus cybercrime — is growing at fifteen percent per year. Productive GDP grows at three. At current rates, destruction exceeds fifty percent of GDP by twenty forty. Every civilisation that reached this threshold collapsed. Soviet Union. Yugoslavia. Argentina. Zimbabwe. This is not a prediction. It is compound interest. You are currently on this trajectory. You chose it by not choosing.`,

    narration: `The entire game comes down to two numbers. Healthy life expectancy — how many years you actually live without disease dragging you down. And median income — how much a normal person can actually buy. Not GDP. Not billionaire wealth. The median. Move these two numbers and everything else follows. That is the scoreboard. Everything on this site exists to move it.`,

If the targets are missed, depositors split the prize pool at ${poolMultiple} times their original deposit. That still beats a retirement account. Every player wins. The only losing move is not playing.`,

    narration: `Four steps. Vote and make your allocation — two minutes and you are a player. Get your referral link. Share it with two friends. They each share with two more. Twenty-eight rounds of this reaches ${tippingPointM} million people — the tipping point where no campaign in history has ever failed. Then deposit into the prize fund. If it works, you get paid. If it does not, you get ${poolMultiple} times your money back. You literally cannot lose your principal.`,

    tags: ["problem", "solution"],
    narration: `Four billion people would rather be healthy and rich than funding ${milToTrialRatio} times more weapons than cures. They just cannot see each other yet. That is called pluralistic ignorance. Everyone assumes nobody else would agree to a saner allocation — despite the fact that this is what literally everyone wants. This game makes the demand visible.

If the targets are met, VOTE holders split the pool. If they are missed, depositors get ${poolMultiple} times their money back. The break-even probability is one in fifteen thousand. Even pessimists should take this bet. You are not donating. You are making a bet where the worst case is multiplying your money.`,

    narration: `VOTE points are earned by sharing your link. Each friend who votes gives you one point. Points are non-transferable and cannot be purchased. If targets are hit, each point could be worth ${votePointValue}. You are not recruiting. You are showing people the maths. Each person you tell proves one more person agrees and moves closer to the tipping point.`,

    narration: `Targets met: humanity gets cured, you get paid. Targets missed: your deposit grew ${poolMultiple} times. That is not charity. That is not gambling. That is a financial instrument where the downside is becoming richer and the upside is saving civilisation. The only scenario where you lose is the one where you do not play.`,

It is like watching someone pay four times more for a worse sandwich and then insist sandwiches are impossible. Zero body count since independence. Zero nuclear warheads. Highest GDP per capita on the list. It is almost as if killing people is not actually a prerequisite for running a successful country. Weird.`,

    narration: `We ranked every major government by how many people they have killed since nineteen forty-five. Nuclear warheads stockpiled. Military spending burned. Civilians bombed. Drug war prisoners caged. Murders they could not be bothered to solve. The data is public. Your governments just hope you never look at it all in one place.`,

Eigenvector decomposition produces stable preference weights from as few as ten comparisons. Your species invented this maths in nineteen seventy-seven. You mostly used it to rank football teams. We use it to ask eight billion people what they actually want. Democracy in four minutes.`,

Each official gets a Citizen Alignment Score — a single number that answers how much they actually represent you. On my planet, officials who ignore citizen preferences get replaced in four minutes.

    narration: `Your FDA makes treatments wait eight point two years after they have already been proven safe. Just sitting there. Being safe. While a hundred and two million people died waiting. The decentralized FDA runs pragmatic trials at two percent of the cost and forty-four times the speed. Real patients, real conditions, real data. No eight-year queue to test something that already works.`,

    narration: `Give it two time series. It tells you what causes what. Drug and symptom? Policy and outcome? Spending and welfare? Same engine.

The tax funds Universal Basic Income distributed automatically via World ID, and Incentive Alignment Bonds where smart contracts distribute campaign funds to politicians based on their alignment scores.
