Your governments spend ${spendingRatio} more on weapons than on testing which medicines work. The 1% Treaty redirects 1% of the murder budget to clinical trials. We need ${tippingPoint} players to hit the tipping point.\n\nYour move: tell two friends. Not "recruit referrals." Not "leverage your network." Tell two actual humans you know.

The only thing between here and there is ${tippingPoint} votes. You are one. You need two more. Two friends. Ideally ones with thumbs and a phone.\n\nOn my planet, when someone discovers a solution to mass death, they tell people about it.

One text message to one friend takes 30 seconds. You spent longer than that choosing which photo filter makes your lunch look less sad.\n\nThe game only works if people play it.
