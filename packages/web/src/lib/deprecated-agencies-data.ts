      "Instead of scientists spending half their careers writing grant proposals that get 40 minutes of review, dIH subsidises patients directly. Funding is proportional to disease burden (DALYs). Patients choose which pragmatic trial to join. At $929/patient instead of $27,800, the same money runs 30x more trials with 30x more patients. All results — positive and negative — are published in an open data commons.",
