            &ldquo;Just print more money for medicine&rdquo; doesn&apos;t work.
            When the central bank inflates the overall money supply by 50%,
            military budgets also rise 50%. The ratio stays at 604:1. Real
            resources — brains, factories, hours — are unchanged. Only nominal
            numbers inflate. You cannot print your way out of misallocation.
            You have to actually change what the system optimises for.
