    description:
      "Depositors fund the Earth Optimization Prize. Recruiters share referral links and get people to verify support for the 1% Treaty via World ID. Every verified voter earns the recruiter a VOTE token. Depositors get ~4.2x their money back if the plan fails. Recruiters get prize share if it succeeds. Pluralistic ignorance collapses.",
    why: "Depositors get a yield floor. Recruiters get a bounty. Self-interest does the coordination.",

    title: "The Great Clicking",
    description:
      "Citizens do pairwise comparisons on their priorities. Ten comparisons, two minutes, and the eigenvector decomposition produces a stable budget allocation. Enough people click and you have a mandate no politician can ignore.",
    why: "It takes less time than complaining on social media.",
  },
  {
    step: 3,
    title: "Lobby for the Treaty",
    description:
      "Demand is proven. Now sell Incentive Alignment Bonds to raise ~$1B for the lobbying campaign. Treaty revenue splits 80/10/10 by smart contract: 80% funds pragmatic clinical trials, 10% returns to bondholders, 10% funds a SuperPAC for aligned politicians. Self-reinforcing loop: diseases cured → GDP rises → everyone lobbies for expansion.",
    why: "Attractive return profile. Fail? ~4.2x back. Succeed? Perpetual 10% of treaty revenue.",
  },

    step: 4,
    title: "Full Optimization",
    description:
      "Automate monetary policy for 0% inflation. Replace the IRS and welfare bureaucracy with a flat 0.5% transaction tax and Universal Basic Income. Automate Congress through Wishocratic allocation — 8 billion people directing public goods spending via pairwise comparisons instead of 535 politicians directing it based on campaign donors.",
    why: "Cheaper, fairer, and the spreadsheet agrees it's better.",
  },
  {
    step: 5,
    title: "Enjoy Results",
    description:
      "Median healthy life years go up. Median real income goes up. The dysfunction tax disappears. Bondholders get paid. Recruiters get paid. Everyone wins except the middlemen. Oh well.",
    why: "You like living longer and having more money. Presumably.",

          Every step is driven by self-interest. That&apos;s the point. Systems that
          require everyone to be nice don&apos;t scale. Systems that make selfishness
