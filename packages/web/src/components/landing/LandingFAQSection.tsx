    answer:
      "Zero team allocation. No pre-sale. No admin keys. Every transaction is on-chain and auditable. The smart contract controls distribution — not a committee, not a founder, not an alien. It's a dominant assurance contract: the mechanism literally guarantees you can't lose your principal. The code is on GitHub. Read it.",

    id: "politicians",
    question: "Can politicians just ignore this?",
    answer: <>Chenoweth&apos;s research shows that 3.5% of a population is the tipping point for political change — no campaign in history has failed after reaching it. That&apos;s <ParameterValue param={TREATY_CAMPAIGN_VOTING_BLOC_TARGET} display="withUnit" /> verified supporters globally. The referendum doesn&apos;t ask permission. It proves demand. Once demand is undeniable, ignoring it becomes more expensive than acting on it.</>,
  },
  {
    id: "fails",
    question: "What if the plan fails?",
    answer: <>That&apos;s the entire point of dominant assurance. If the plan fails after 15 years, depositors claim their principal plus projected ~<ParameterValue param={PRIZE_POOL_HORIZON_MULTIPLE} display="withUnit" /> in Prize fund growth (based on VC-sector diversification). All return figures are hypothetical projections, not guarantees.</>,
  },
  {
    id: "trust",
    question: "Why should I trust an alien?",
    answer:
      "You shouldn't. Trust the smart contracts. They're open source, deployed on a public blockchain, with no admin keys. The alien is just the narrator. The maths works whether or not you find her charming. VoterPrizeTreasury.sol and VoteToken.sol — full source on GitHub.",
  },
  {
    id: "share",
    question: "Why should I share this with friends?",
    answer: <>Everyone would be healthier and <ParameterValue param={{...TREATY_TRAJECTORY_AVG_INCOME_YEAR_15, value: Math.round(TREATY_TRAJECTORY_AVG_INCOME_YEAR_15.value / CURRENT_TRAJECTORY_AVG_INCOME_YEAR_15.value), unit: ""}} display="integer" />x richer if their governments weren&apos;t spending <ParameterValue param={MILITARY_TO_GOVERNMENT_CLINICAL_TRIALS_SPENDING_RATIO} display="integer" /> times more on blowing everything up than on clinical trials. But everyone assumes nobody else would agree to a saner allocation — despite the fact that this is what literally everyone wants. That&apos;s called pluralistic ignorance and it&apos;s the only thing standing between you and a cured planet. Each friend who plays proves one more person agrees, earns you a {POINT} — your share of the prize pool if targets are met — and moves closer to the tipping point. You&apos;re not asking for a favour. You&apos;re showing them the maths.</>,
