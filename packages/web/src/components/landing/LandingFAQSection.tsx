    question: "Isn't this a scam?",
    answer:
      "Zero team allocation. No pre-sale. No admin keys. Every transaction is on-chain and auditable. The smart contract controls distribution — not a committee, not a founder, not an alien. It's a dominant assurance contract: the mechanism literally guarantees you can't lose your principal. The code is on GitHub. Read it.",

    id: "politicians",
    question: "Can politicians just ignore this?",
    answer: `Chenoweth's research shows that 3.5% of a population is the tipping point for political change — no campaign in history has failed after reaching it. That's ${fmtParam(TREATY_CAMPAIGN_VOTING_BLOC_TARGET)} verified supporters globally. The referendum doesn't ask permission. It proves demand. Once demand is undeniable, ignoring it becomes more expensive than acting on it.`,
  },
  {
    id: "fails",
    question: "What if the plan fails?",
    answer: `That's the entire point of dominant assurance. If the plan fails after 15 years, depositors claim their principal plus ~${fmtParam(PRIZE_POOL_HORIZON_MULTIPLE)} in Wishocratic fund growth. You're not donating. You're making a bet where the worst case is multiplying your money. The plan failing is the scenario designed to make you rich.`,

  {
    id: "trust",
    question: "Why should I trust an alien?",
    answer:
      "You shouldn't. Trust the smart contracts. They're open source, deployed on a public blockchain, with no admin keys. The alien is just the narrator. The maths works whether or not you find her charming. VoterPrizeTreasury.sol and VoteToken.sol — full source on GitHub.",
