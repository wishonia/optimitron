## Optomitron Schema (QuantiModo Heritage)

The Optomitron schema (`@optomitron/db`) was inspired by the QuantiModo PostgreSQL database. We extracted and modernized the essential models for the universal measurement system from the original 115-table schema.

**Source Repository:** [mikepsinn/quantimodo-api](https://github.com/mikepsinn/quantimodo-api)

**Schema Location:** `database/ddl/postgres-v0/public/`

### Table Mapping

| QuantiModo DDL File | Optomitron Model | Purpose |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| `measurements.sql` | `Measurement` | Individual data points (timestamp, value, unit, source) |
| `variables.sql` | `GlobalVariable` | Canonical variable definitions (name, category, default unit, combination method) |
| `user_variables.sql` | `UserVariable` | Per-user variable settings (onset delay, duration of action, filling type, personal stats) |
| `units.sql` | `Unit` | Unit definitions with conversion factors (mg, hours, rating/5, etc.) |
| `variable_categories.sql` | `VariableCategory` | Variable groupings (Treatments, Symptoms, Biomarkers, Foods, etc.) |
| `tracking_reminders.sql` | `TrackingReminder` | Scheduled measurement prompts |
| `correlations.sql` | `UserVariableRelationship` | Per-user causal analysis results (PIS, effect size, optimal value) |
| `aggregate_correlations.sql` | `GlobalVariableRelationship` | Population-level aggregated causal analysis results |

**Note:** The original QuantiModo database has 115 tables covering OAuth, social features, purchases, studies, and more. We intentionally ported only the core measurement and analysis tables — the minimal set needed for the universal measurement system and causal inference pipeline.

## Health Data Standards

Standards referenced for data import/export and interoperability. Optomitron has its own schema (see `@optomitron/db`) — inspired by QuantiModo but redesigned for modern TypeScript, local-first architecture, and domain-agnostic use.

| Standard | URL | Usage in Optomitron |
|----------|-----|---------------------|
| **FHIR R4** (HL7) | [hl7.org/fhir](https://hl7.org/fhir/) | Import/export format for clinical data (Observations, Conditions, MedicationStatements). Maps to `Measurement` model on import. Not used as internal schema. |
| **OMOP CDM** (OHDSI) | [CommonDataModel](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/) | Reference for observational health research. Informs our approach to variable standardization and outcome definitions. |
| **Apple Health XML** | Apple HealthKit export format | Layer 1 data import — parses `export.xml` into `Measurement` records. Supports HKQuantityType, HKCategoryType, workout data. |
| **Google Health Connect** | Android Health Connect API | Layer 1 data import — Android equivalent of Apple Health. Reads exercise, nutrition, sleep, vitals, body measurements. |

---

## Proof of Personhood / Identity

Layer 2 of the architecture. Enables anonymous but deduplicated contributions (one person = one vote/submission). User chooses their provider.

| Provider | URL | Method | Sybil Resistance | Privacy |
|----------|-----|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Holonym** | [holonym.id](https://holonym.id/) | ZK identity proofs from government ID | High (gov ID + ZK) | Strong (zero-knowledge, no data leaves device) |
| **Gitcoin Passport** | [passport.gitcoin.co](https://passport.gitcoin.co/) | Composable stamp-based scoring (social, on-chain, identity) | Medium (stamp accumulation) | Medium (pseudonymous) |
| **Worldcoin / World ID** | [worldcoin.org/world-id](https://worldcoin.org/world-id) | Iris biometric hash (Orb device) | Very high (biometric uniqueness) | Medium (biometric, hash stored) |
| **human.tech** | [human.tech](https://human.tech/) | Social graph proofs, decentralized identity | Medium-high | Strong (social proof, no biometrics) |

**Key properties for Layer 2:**
- **Uniqueness** — Each human can only submit once per time period
- **Unlinkability** — Submissions cannot be linked to each other or to real identity
- **Revocability** — User can rotate credentials without losing contribution history
- **Composability** — Multiple proof methods can be combined for higher confidence

---

## Crypto / On-Chain Infrastructure

Technologies for Layer 3 (on-chain submission) and Layer 5 (incentives).

### Local-First Database

| Technology | URL | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| **PGlite** (Postgres in browser) | [electric-sql.com/product/pglite](https://electric-sql.com/product/pglite) | Run full PostgreSQL in WebAssembly for Layer 1 local storage — enables complex queries on device without a server |
| **cr-sqlite** (CRDT sync) | [vlcn.io/docs/cr-sqlite/intro](https://vlcn.io/docs/cr-sqlite/intro) | Conflict-free replicated SQLite for peer-to-peer data sync between user devices |

### Smart Contracts

Existing Solidity contracts from the Wishocracy repo serve as a starting point for Phase 5 (Incentive Alignment Bonds):

```
https://github.com/mikepsinn/wishocracy/tree/main/contracts/
├── genie-dao-factory.sol    # DAO creation and governance
├── wish-ubi.sol             # Universal basic income distribution
└── wishing-well.sol         # Treasury and fund allocation
```

**Phase 5 will need:**
- IAB Treasury contract (accepts donations, holds funds)
- Alignment-score-based automatic fund distribution
- Data contribution token (governance/utility)
- On-chain data schema for effect sizes, preference weights, evidence grades
