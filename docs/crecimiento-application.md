# Crecimiento Application

## One-Sentence Pitch
Optomitron is open-source infrastructure for evidence-based governance: it helps citizens express priorities, measures where government spending diverges from those priorities, runs reproducible causal analysis on policy options, and publishes auditable receipts for every recommendation.

## Problem
Most governments can tell you how much they spent. Far fewer can tell you whether that spending caused better outcomes, whether citizens wanted that allocation, or whether the recommendation process can be independently audited afterward.

This is especially painful in fast-growing regions and fiscally constrained jurisdictions, where every marginal budget decision matters more and institutional trust is often lower. Leaders need a way to move from rhetoric to evidence without buying into opaque proprietary systems.

## Product
Optomitron combines four pieces:

1. A domain-agnostic causal inference engine that estimates impact, confidence, and optimal levels from time-series data.
2. Wishocracy preference aggregation so citizens can express priorities through structured pairwise comparisons.
3. Storacha-backed content-addressed storage for immutable aggregation and analysis snapshots.
4. Hypercert and ERC-8004 compatible publication receipts so an autonomous analysis agent can produce verifiable public outputs instead of unverifiable summaries.

In practice, that means a jurisdiction can ask:

- What do citizens want most?
- Where is the biggest preference gap relative to current allocation?
- Which policies or spending changes have the strongest evidence of improving outcomes?
- What exact data and reasoning produced that conclusion?

## Why Now
AI can now synthesize and explain complex analytical outputs, but most governance workflows still lack a trustworthy receipt layer. At the same time, open data availability is improving while public trust in institutions is deteriorating.

That creates a narrow window for products that combine:

- rigorous measurement
- explainable AI reasoning
- verifiable storage and attestation
- open-source governance tooling

Optomitron is already built around that stack.

## What Exists Today
- Open-source monorepo with roughly 1,737 pre-existing tests before the PL Genesis integrations
- Live demo with budget and policy optimization analyses
- Published papers for the core methods
- Working preference aggregation, policy scoring, budget optimization, and data ingestion packages
- New Storacha, Hypercerts, and autonomous agent packages integrated into the same workspace

## Why We Can Build This
The founder has already built large-scale health-data and causal analysis infrastructure with real users. Optomitron is not an idea-stage slide deck; it is the continuation of a longer line of product and research work, now adapted to governance and public-goods coordination.

The team advantage is unusual:

- deep causal inference methodology
- practical data engineering
- comfort with crypto-native receipt layers
- a strong bias toward transparent, testable systems rather than consultancy theater

## Why Crecimiento
Crecimiento is attractive because Optomitron sits at the intersection of public infrastructure, institutional decision quality, and scalable software. The right accelerator environment would help with:

1. pilot design with jurisdictions or civic partners
2. distribution into policy, research, and public-interest networks
3. refining the product surface for non-technical operators
4. converting strong technical infrastructure into repeatable adoption

## 12-Month Plan
If accepted, the next 12 months focus on turning the current stack into repeatable deployments.

1. Run pilot analyses for a small set of jurisdictions with public outcome and spending data.
2. Expand the Wishocracy preference collection workflow for live citizen input.
3. Ship stronger reporting, audit, and operator tooling around the autonomous agent.
4. Use Hypercerts, Storacha, and ERC-8004 receipts to make every analysis externally reviewable.

## Long-Term Vision
The long-term goal is not just better dashboards. It is an evidence layer for governance that can be reused across countries, cities, nonprofits, and research groups. If budgets shape human outcomes, then public reasoning about budgets should be open infrastructure.

Optomitron is building that infrastructure.
