# User Stories & Revenue Strategy

## User Personas (ordered by revenue potential)

### 1. 🏛️ Political Campaigns & SuperPACs — **$$$$$**
**The IAB Play** — Incentive Alignment Bonds

**Stories:**
- "As a campaign manager, I want to know which policy positions maximize voter alignment so I can win elections"
- "As a SuperPAC, I want to fund candidates who are genuinely aligned with citizens' preferences, not just popular"
- "As a donor, I want proof that my money goes to candidates who will actually vote for what people want"

**Features needed:**
- [x] Citizen preference aggregation (Wishocracy — live pairwise vote flow)
- [x] Politician voting record analysis (Congress.gov fetcher + benchmark sync path)
- [x] Alignment scoring (politician vs citizen preferences)
- [ ] Campaign recommendation engine ("run on these 5 policies")
- [ ] Donor dashboard ("your aligned candidates")
- [ ] IAB smart contracts (Phase 4)

**Revenue:** Campaign consulting, alignment data licensing, IAB bond fees
**Timeline:** Medium — need citizen preference data first (chicken-and-egg)

### 2. 🔬 Policy Researchers & Think Tanks — **$$$$**
**The Data Play**

**Stories:**
- "As a researcher, I want cross-country policy comparisons with real outcome data"
- "As a think tank, I want evidence-based policy recommendations for a specific jurisdiction"
- "As a government advisor, I want to know the optimal budget allocation backed by data"

**Features needed:**
- [x] International comparison dashboards (71 countries, 4 domains)
- [ ] Custom jurisdiction analysis (run OBG/OPG for any city/state/country)
- [ ] API access for programmatic queries
- [ ] PDF report generation
- [ ] Custom dataset uploads

**Revenue:** API subscriptions ($99-999/mo), custom reports ($5K-50K), consulting
**Timeline:** Short — data and analysis already built, just need API + paywall

### 3. 🗳️ Citizens & Voters — **$ (but builds the moat)**
**The Preference Play** — most important for long-term value

**Stories:**
- "As a voter, I want to see how my tax dollars are currently spent vs how they should be spent"
- "As a citizen, I want to compare politicians by how well they represent my preferences"
- "As a taxpayer, I want to vote on budget priorities and see what the optimal allocation would be"
- "As a concerned citizen, I want to see what policies other countries use that work better"

**Features needed:**
- [x] Budget visualization
- [x] Policy rankings
- [x] International comparisons
- [x] **Pairwise comparison UI** — "Which matters more: Education or Defense?" (Wishocracy)
- [x] **Personal alignment report** — "Here are the politicians most aligned with YOUR preferences"
- [x] **Share/embed** — public alignment report URLs and in-app sharing
- [ ] Geo-aware representative matching — "Show me my officials first"
- [ ] Sybil-resistant public aggregation for community rankings

**Revenue:** Free tier + donations, Gitcoin quadratic funding, "premium" detailed reports
**Timeline:** Short — core citizen loop is live; next gaps are real legislative allocation ingestion and trusted public aggregation

### 4. 📰 Journalists & Media — **$$ (exposure)**
**The Story Play**

**Stories:**
- "As a journalist, I want data-driven stories about government spending efficiency"
- "As a data reporter, I want embeddable charts comparing countries"

**Features needed:**
- [ ] Embeddable widgets / iframes
- [ ] Shareable chart URLs (og:image for social media previews)
- [ ] Data download (CSV/JSON)

**Revenue:** Attribution drives traffic → more users → more preference data
**Timeline:** Medium

**The Personal Optimization Play**

**Stories:**
- "As a health tracker, I want to know which supplements actually work for me"
- "As a patient, I want to find my optimal dosage based on my own data"
- "As a biohacker, I want causal inference on my Apple Health data"

**Features needed:**
- [ ] Health data import (Apple Health, Fitbit, etc. — ✅ DONE)
- [ ] Personal analysis pipeline (✅ DONE)
- [ ] Report generation (✅ DONE)
- [x] User accounts + basic profile/census storage
- [x] Daily health/happiness/income tracking
- [ ] Health data upload into user accounts

**Timeline:** Long — needs accounts, data upload, privacy infrastructure
